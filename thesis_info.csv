5,Spoiler' Violence and Other Myths: A Mixed Methods Study of Paramilitaries' Use of Force in Northern Ireland,"Tam, Claire",Political Science,2015,,"While many scholars have written about 'spoilers,' actors committed to the use of violence in an effort to undermine political negotiations, there have been few attempts to systematically test whether theories of spoiling behavior truly effectively explain armed nonstate actors' use of force. Using a combination of GIS mapping, statistical analysis, and qualitative data gathered from interviews in Belfast, Northern Ireland, I examine the lines of division that formed within Northern Irish paramilitaries during the peace process of the 1990s. By focusing in particular on what I define as intra-movement violence, I examine the way divisions formed and test whether these fissures reflect a moderate-militant divide over peace negotiations. Ultimately, I find that evidence from Northern Ireland is more consistent with an explanation that identifies lines of division relating to intra-movement factors such as local competition or involvement with crime."

I discuss three of my pieces, ""26"", ""The Bicyclist"" and ""The World Consciousness Database"" and how the elements of images, text and code affect the narrative experience of each piece. Throughout the course of making these stories, I realize that the underlying code is just as important to the visual presentation and narrative experience of each piece as the surface text and images."
8,"Looking Through Death's Veil: Keats, Mortality, and Medicine","Garvey, Sarah Lauren",English,2015,"Tyler, Luther Terrell","John Keats prophesied that, ""I think I shall be among the English poets after my death,"" and strove throughout his short life to produce poetry that would elevate him to the same level as Shakespeare and Milton before him. While he received mostly antagonistic literary reviews during his lifetime, Keats has since become one of the most beloved of the Romantic poets. His poetry, strongly influenced by his youthful passion and the urgency of his quickly deteriorating health, blossomed between the years of 1818-1820, right before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25. By utilizing primary source documents, I analyze his poems within the context of letters he wrote to his close friends and family, which paint a near complete portrait of the inner workings of the poet's mind. My thesis focuses on how his physician's training influenced his poetry, as well as how the circumstances surrounding his life shaped his writing, his views on life, and his own apparent mortality."

10,Discourses of Exemplarity in Propertius IV,"Thayer, Madeline",Classical Studies,2015,"Young, Liz
Starr, Raymond","Exemplarity is a commonly observed feature of the Roman cultural landscape, be it in respect to literature, monuments, or portraiture. Particularly in Augustan Rome, exemplary figures were utilized to express common cultural values intended to serve as a guide to moral conduct, and were intended to draw from the past in an attempt to unify and render cohesive a state that had suffered many years of civil war. Exemplary figures also served to ground Augustus's rule in the past. This thesis looks at exemplarity in Book IV of Propertius's Elegies, specifically regarding two characters, Cornelia and Tarpeia. Rather than expressing a single, easily understood value and thus serving a function as a template of behavior, Propertius, within the text, instead destabilizes the ideas that these characters supposedly represent, and thus complicates essential pillars of Roman identity."
11,Private Military Contractors as a Risk-Transfer Mechanism: The Case of Plan Colombia,"Bianchi, Kendall",Political Science,2015,"Goddard, Stacie
MacDonald, Paul","This thesis examines the use of private military contractors (PMCs) in small-scale military missions, using the case study of American counternarcotics and counterinsurgency aid for Plan Colombia as an example. During the early 2000s and beyond, the United States relied heavily on private companies to support its assistance package to the Colombian government. Political limits on U.S. involvement in the country led U.S. officials to attempt to preserve operational flexibility in part by transferring casualty risks away from the military and toward employees of private companies. This use of contractors as a risk-transfer mechanism, however, increased the overall risk the United States faced in Colombia in three ways. First, it introduced moral hazard on the part of the government agencies involved. Second, it transferred control over risk from a highly risk-averse entity (the government) to a relatively non-risk averse entity (PMCs). And third, it placed profit incentives near the tip of the so-called U.S. spear in Colombia, undermining safety precautions and resulting in extra and unnecessary casualty risks for personnel involved. Unlike other analyses of the risks produced by contractors in war, my approach focuses on how the operational concept behind privatization of certain tasks generates risk. While many scholars have studied the risks inherent in using private companies on the battlefield, my research analyzes the way in which government decisions about when, where, and how to use contractors create additional casualty risks."
12,How Wales Was Made So Happy: Exploring Nation and Nonsense in Shakespeare's Treatment of the Welsh,"Moore, Morgan",Medieval and Renaissance Studies,2015,"Wall-Randell, Sarah","With famous lines like ""On, on, you noblest English!,"" and ""This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,"" Shakespeare's plays-especially the histories- are famous for their role in creating and glorifying English national identity. But equally important to an understanding of Shakespeare's canon are minority British identities, and of these the most prevalent and most overlooked are the Welsh. This thesis focuses on Shakespeare's Welsh characters, their roles and presentations, and chooses to examine the often paradoxical portrayals of such Welsh characters. In focusing on Sir Hugh Evans from The Merry Wives of Windsor, Fluellen from Henry V, Owen Glendower and Lady Mortimer from Henry IV Part One, and the landscape of Wales depicted in Cymbeline, I argue that there is a powerful duality of the foreign and familiar, absurdity and respectability, embedded in Shakespeare's Welshmen which is in keeping with the theory of beneficial and productive ""nonsense"" put forward by Stephen Booth- and which becomes apparent, and deeply significant, in performance."

Coile, Courtney
McKnight, Robin","Increasing taxation, reducing benefits, and raising the retirement age are popular topics of debate surrounding the Social Security program. Past research has shown that lower benefits decrease independent living and homeownership, and increases poverty amongst the elderly. However, the ability to live in desirable locations also impacts welfare. How do Social Security benefits reductions impact elderly migration and location choice? Higher local wages generally compensate higher local housing costs. However, unlike their children, Social Security recipients have mostly retired. With soaring metropolitan real estate prices and rent hikes, are those relying on Social Security benefits forced to move from high-cost to low-cost locations? What are the impacts on welfare if the elderly must live in lower-cost areas or potentially live farther from their children? I shed light on these questions by exploiting the Social Security notch to examine the effects of an exogenous decrease in Social Security benefits on where the elderly have chosen to live."

Joseph, William","As the world marveled at China's rapid growth of economic and military power in the past few decades, China's soft power expansion has received relatively little attention. My research looks at Chinese university programs that have attracted an increasing number of Arab students in recent years, which coincides with China's larger scheme of soft power projection in the MENA region. Through quantitative analysis of an original survey and interviews with Arab students in China, I attempt to examine whether Chinese university programs can effectively enhance China's soft power in the Arab World. My research finds that studying in China can lead to more favorable feelings toward China among Arab students as a result of increased familiarity and understanding of Chinese language, culture, society, and people. However, this positive change of impression has little to do with the length of time students spend studying in China. Their academic experience in Chinese universities does not seem to contribute significantly to this change either."
18,Privacy Implications of New York City's Stop-and-Frisk Data,"Manfredi, Veronica",Computer Science,2015,"Mir, Darakhshan","A wider release of police datasets could enable social scientists, community activists, and civil libertarians to more effectively challenge discriminatory policing practices. However, the privacy implications of such sharing must be carefully considered. It is known that ""de-identifying"" data is not sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals. New York City's stop-and-frisk data is an example of one such police dataset. The stop-and-frisk data contains information (including demographic information) about all people stopped by the program from 2003 to 2012. This paper examines the identifiability of this data. It examines the uniqueness of the data to investigate the privacy implications of its release for the individuals targeted by stop-and-frisk. It also suggests ways to re-identify this data."

A Study of Exoticism in Fanny Hensel's Lieder,"Zhang, Xi",Music,2015,"Fontijn, Claire","Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel (1805-46) was a gifted pianist and composer of songs known as Lieder, among other music. Though educated together with her brother Felix Mendelssohn and encouraged to excel, their careers diverged at a certain point such that Mendelssohn pursued a public career as a performer and composer, while Hensel's career was restricted to the domestic sphere. Her deep longing for travel and the exotic was reflected in her music. The two journeys from Berlin during her lifetime - Switzerland and France during her adolescence (1822), then Italy later in life with her husband and child (1839) - produced several Lieder that reflected her fascination with places beyond Berlin. This thesis explores Hensel's unique contributions to German Romantic music and the circumstances that shaped it."
24,Prosjekt Nytt Nasjonalmuseum: Negotiating a Norwegian Identity,"Huynh, Diana","Political Science
Art",2015,,"There is a vast amount of attention in Norway going into cultural institutions that is supposed define the image of the capital and Norwegian society. The focus on 'building culture' has nevertheless left a lacuna of what or where the Norwegian identity is in relation to this process. Former definitions of the state and the general consensus of what it means to be Norwegian have in many ways changed over the past three decades. I am therefore interested in crafting a response to the fleeting conditions of this Norwegian identity at the start of the century, by considering the way it is represented through the building of a museum. As a case study, the new National Museum of Arts, Architecture and Design in Oslo, or Nasjonalmuseet as it is better known, can in many ways be described as an interface that bridges the 'new' ideas with the 'old', and thereby revealing how the formulation of what the Norwegian identity might be is under negotiation My discussion exists amidst a larger discourse of the role cultural institutions and urban development play in the formulation of a Norwegian identity in the twenty-first century. In addition to arrive at predictions about the new museum as such, I hope to respond to how this is reflective of a broader framework of the cultural, economic and political situations in Norway."

I found with continued investigation that these three aspects are intrinsically connected, which can be shown musically through careful compositional techniques. Using sounds recorded from nature, specifically sounds I recorded on my trip to the rainforests of Costa Rica this winter, I had my ""notes"" to form my composition, and my responsibility was then the same as any other composer: create something that evokes thought or emotions from sounds. With this interactive sound installation, I hope to pass the proverbial baton to the audience so they themselves can be the composers and surround themselves in a rich sound and visual space."

Cheek, Jonathan M.","Data from a long-term longitudinal study were used to investigate the relationship between grandiose narcissism in adolescence (ages 15-18) and psychological health in late adulthood (age 70s). Participants were born in 1920s in the San Francisco Bay Area and were assessed in adolescence and four times in adulthood (age 30s, 40s, 50s and 70s). Narcissism was assessed with the observer-based California Q-set and psychological health in late adulthood was measured with an index comprising of self-reported ratings of depression, life satisfaction, and mental health. Adolescent narcissism predicted poor psychological health in late adulthood even after accounting for socio-demographic characteristics, psychological health in late adolescence, and narcissism measured in adulthood. The association between adolescent narcissism and psychological health in late adulthood was moderated by the experience of stressful life events in early adulthood, especially those involving personal conflicts and death in the family. Poor psychological health in late adulthood was particularly characteristic of female adolescents who scored high on narcissism, and subsequently experienced personal conflicts in their 20s and early 30s."
40,A Tale of Two Airstrikes: The Effect of Mass-Casualty Airstrikes on Security in Farah and Kunduz Provinces,"Rathod, Saraswati",Political Science,2015,"MacDonald, Paul K.
Goddard, Stacie","Airstrikes have been thrust into the spotlight recently, in part because of their integral role in the campaign against the Islamic State but also because of the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen. In fact, air power has long been a critical component of U.S. strategy in counterinsurgency warfare. If we are to continue to use airstrikes in order to fight violent extremism, we must understand their effects on local security. Yet relatively little satisfying research exists which explores the effects of airstrikes on local levels of violence. Previous studies limit themselves to tracking the number and location of insurgent attacks rather than examining the broader character of insurgent violence and how much that violence impacts the daily lives of local residents. Additionally, large nation-wide statistical analyses prevent us from deeply examining the ways in which specific local conditions influence the repercussions of an airstrike. Overall, more nuance is needed if we are to truly understand the effect of airstrikes on local insurgent violence. In this study, I turn to two cases in Afghanistan-the May 4 airstrike in Farah Province and the September 4 airstrike in Kunduz Province. Both incidents were mass-casualty airstrikes, which resulted in the deaths of over 100 civilians by some estimates. I used news reports and interviews with three military personnel and a civilian aid worker who were on the ground in Kunduz to better understand the effect of the airstrikes on local security. The results were entirely different in the two cases. While the Farah airstrike resulted in widespread political backlash and an increase in insurgent violence, the Kunduz airstrike resulted in virtually no political backlash and a decrease in insurgent violence. All in all, the results demonstrate that the changes in the security landscape, even after a large mass-casualty airstrike, are subtle and contingent upon local conditions."
41,Evaluating the Effectiveness of US Strikes as a Counterterrorism Policy in Yemen,"Ganesh, Lavanya",Political Science,2015,"MacDonald, Paul K.","The effectiveness of drone strikes as a counterterrorism measure is the core of U.S policymakers' arguments for their continued use. With Yemen becoming a critical topic of national security due to the growing strength of al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP), an assessment about the effectiveness of drone strikes should allow for officials and critics alike to evaluate the tradeoffs associated with drone warfare. This thesis studies the impact of US counterterrorism policy on AQAP violence using regression analysis and qualitative methods."

A lack of access to the technical training required to develop compositional skills is often cited as a primary reason women composers struggled to reach the same prominence as their male colleagues. Living in an ostensibly egalitarian society, Gubaidulina and Ustvolskaya were treated as equal to their male counterparts and given greater access to education than many women in the West. This increased access to musical education represents an unprecedented experiment in classical music history. Both Gubaidulina and Ustvolskaya developed compositional styles which are neither traditional nor avant-garde, but strikingly unique. In the face of a regime which sought to limit their artistic expression, these women found freedom and independence in their music."

I pay particular attention to queer readings of these texts as well as to the role that gender plays in them. I argue that at this time in history, literature is the most definitive authority on the multifarious nature of whales. Whales are a powerful metaphor for politics on land, sexual predation, tyranny, and godliness. Because of their both terrifying and awe-inducing nature, whales are sublime."

51,"Beyond the Loom: Examining the Relationship Among Gender, Textiles, and Architecture at the Bauhaus","Hakanoglu, Orli",Architecture,2016,"Berman, Patricia
Mowbray, Andrew","Nearly 100 years ago, the Bauhaus, the German school of architecture, design, and art, opened its doors to its students. Known for its radical social and artistic experimentation, the design and theory that came from the school is still relevant today. The Bauhaus was founded during a critical moment of social change, one shaped by the horrors of the Great War, by Germany's defeat, and by its economic and political restructuring. The Bauhaus promoted a spirit of equality through its curriculum and output. Yet, the agenda of equality did not reach so far as to eliminate the distinctions between women and men at the Bauhaus. While women were accepted into the school, their exclusion from all workshops other than the weaving workshop indicates a clear division of sexes. My research considers the life, work, and writing of Anni Albers, a student of the Bauhaus whose woven and graphic work is celebrated today. This paper provides a brief background on the historic relationship of gender, weaving, and status before focusing specifically on Albers. In light of the barring of women from architecture, I consider her work as an strategic intervention with the framework of limitations posed by being a woman at the Bauhaus, identifying ways in which she asserted the importance of her craft, aligning it with modern design principles of the Bauhaus. A strong connection exists between Albers' theoretical writing and the principles of modern architecture, as well as a number of discourses of architectural theory. These connections illustrate Albers' attempts to break down gender barriers and carve out a voice for her medium-and by extension, for women-in the modernist movement. In addition to this written thesis, I have also created a Studio Art installation at the Jewett Arts Center related to Anni Albers' work in textiles and their relationship to Architecture. The installation responds to my research by exploring some of Albers' theories at the architectural scale."

55,Ladies in the Bath: Nude Portraiture in the French Renaissance,"Kerwin, Sophie",Art,2016,"Carroll, Margaret","The School of Fontainebleau produced a striking group of portraits depicting nude and half-nude women bathing or at their toilette. These paintings are exceptional for the period in that nudity was primarily reserved for allegorical or mythological contexts. The identity of the women depicted in these mysterious paintings has been a continual source of fascination for scholars who have suggested the royal mistresses Diane de Poitiers, Marie Touchet, Catherine Henriette de Balzac d'Entrague, and Gabrielle d' Estrées as well as the queen Mary Stuart as possible subjects. Beyond the women's precise identities, however, the paintings elicit many questions; this thesis explores the genre and what they reveal to us about the creative and performative nature of women's sexuality and gender at the French Renaissance court."

60,Modeling the Racial Wealth Gap,"Ashman, Hero",Economics,2016,"Weerapana, Akila
Neumuller, Seth","In 2013, the median wealth of white households was 12 times higher than that of black households. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, I explore the wider context of the racial wealth gap, and conclude that lower returns to investment in housing, education, and assets prohibit black households from accumulating similar levels of wealth as white households. Additionally, analysis of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics shows that black and white households not only face different levels of income, but black households experience relatively higher volatility of both the permanent and transitory component of their income. Using a heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with exogenous differences in income profiles, educational attainment, and mortality, I generate endogenous racial differences in wealth accumulation and homeownership rates. The model is only able to explain roughly 6 percent of the observed racial wealth gap, a surprisingly small fraction given the large racial disparities in these factors. This is interesting in its implication that substantial factors beyond income and educational differences are needed to explain the black-white wealth divide. I speculate as to what these factors are, and suggest that a larger share could be explained by an expansion of the mechanisms through which income, education, and mortality, affect wealth accumulation."
61,Voter Discrimination in Democratic Elections,"Barth, Suzanne",Economics,2016,"Park, Kyung H.","After the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, many have begun to doubt the continued relevance of candidate race in voter behavior. This study, however, hypothesizes that in low information elections, where candidate's policy preferences are not widely known, voters will discriminate against candidates they perceive as racial or ethnic minorities. This thesis finds evidence of racial and ethnic bias in voter behavior in statewide low profile elections in Texas between 1992 and 2010. Expected candidate race and ethnicity is assigned using U.S. Census Genealogical data and linear regression analysis will be used to measure the change in vote share for the Democratic Party when the candidate race and ethnicity varies."
62,Second Harmonic Generation Imaging of a Magnetic Topological Insulator,"Belvin, Carina",Physics,2016,"Berg, Robbie
Gedik, Nuh","A topological insulator (TI) is a type of quantum material that is insulating in the bulk but metallic on the surface. Due to the unique spin properties of the surface electrons, TIs have attracted much interest for their potential applications in spin-based electronics and quantum computers. Even more exotic effects occur when TIs are brought in contact with magnetic materials. This thesis represents a study of two-layer thin films consisting of the TI Bi2Se3 and the magnetic insulator EuS using a nonlinear optical technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. SHG imaging can probe the crystal and magnetic structure at the surfaces and interfaces of inversion symmetric materials. At the interface between the EuS and Bi2Se3 layers, magnetic domains are expected to form. The domain boundaries are predicted to host chiral edge states, which are dissipationless currents that flow in one direction around a domain. Using SHG imaging, our goal was to visualize the magnetic domains in this magnetic topological insulator system. Even though we have yet to observe any evidence of magnetic domains in this material, we also performed SHG imaging on monolayer MoS2 and were able to visualize distinct crystal grains. Our SHG imaging setup that was improved upon during this thesis has the potential to reveal information about other interesting quantum materials."
63,Interval Orders with Restrictions on the Interval Lengths,"Boyadzhiyska, Simona",Mathematics,2016,"Trenk, Ann","This thesis examines several classes of interval orders arising from restrictions on the permissible interval lengths. We first provide an accessible proof of the characterization theorem for the class of interval orders representable with lengths between 1 and k for each k in { 1,2,...}. We then consider the interval orders representable with lengths exactly 1 and k for k in { 0,1,...}. We characterize the class of interval orders representable with lengths 0 and 1, both structurally and algorithmically. To study the other classes in this family, we consider a related problem, in which each interval has a prescribed length. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for an interval order to have a representation with a given set of prescribed lengths. Using this result, we provide a necessary condition for an interval order to have a representation with lengths 1 and 2."

When we think about the motivations behind Paradise Lost, we first think of Milton's poetic ambition to write the first English epic, and second the subject of creation and the fall of mankind, which is wholly disconnected from the present time. In neither case do we connect the poem to Milton's historical context. I argue that Milton was living in a literary world composed of Classical authors and his peers that had seen important meditations on what a garden can and should be. Milton was also living in a time of emerging awareness about how human actions can both endanger and be influenced by nature. In this paper, I use Milton's vision of paradise as filter to explore the environmental anxieties of early modern London. I will re-situate Paradise Lost in the context of Milton's time and place - early modern London - in order to explore the relationship between Eden and real gardens for English people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By weaving the thread of literary tradition with the thread of Milton's contemporary experiences, we will see Milton's reformist attitudes towards work and nature. In fact, Milton's Eden is a response to the emerging urban and environmental problems of his time - overpopulation, air pollution, rapid urbanization - and an enlightening study on how gardens can influence labor and sexual relations."
69,An Assessment of the Medium Term Impacts of a Honduran Conditional Cash Transfer Experiment on Education and Fertility,"Li, Jacqueline",Economics,2016,"McEwan, Patrick
Butcher, Kristin","Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have been widely used in the developing world as a tool to break the poverty cycle. Short-term studies have found positive impacts of CCTs on education and health outcomes. However, little is known about longer-term outcomes of beneficiaries and any unintended consequences, namely on fertility, that there may be. This paper assesses medium-term (5-6 years after program implementation) impacts of a Honduran CCT, PRAF-II, on education and fertility. PRAF-II was a random experiment that provided cash transfers to 40 out of 70 poor municipalities. Conditions included school enrollment and regular health checkups. Using data from USAID's Honduran DHS Survey from 2005-2006, I find that very young children receiving cash transfers conditioned on health checkups were more likely to enroll in primary school on time. Children receiving cash transfers conditioned on school enrollment saw sustained increases in education acquisition, even after cash payments ended. Finally, I find that there was no persistent impact on fertility, as women simply moved forward their birthing decisions."

Goddard, Stacie
Weerapana, Akila","How do natural resources affect political violence? Natural resources may increase the opportunity for rebels to profit from violence, or they may weaken state capacity, allowing rebels to fight more easily. Previous empirical analyses on this question have used broad variables to capture micro-level mechanisms linking resources to violence. I instead aggregate sub-national data on political violence, resource availability, and other covariates in Africa from 1997-2014 to explore the links between resources and conflict within countries rather than across countries. The results from a fixed effects specification suggest that lootable resources increase the probability and the intensity of rebel violence, while unlootable resources do not. I also find that districts with both lootable resources and excluded ethnic groups have a significantly higher probability of political violence than those with one of these factors or with neither. To further explore the complex interactions of resources, ethnicity, and state strength, I use a qualitative case study comparison between resource-rich regions in the Niger Delta and in western Gabon, which have seen repeated rebel violence and prolonged peace, respectively. Overall, these findings suggest that counterinsurgency tactics targeted at preventing resource looting, as well as policies that address long-term grievances such as ethnic exclusion, may be most effective in preventing rebel violence."

74,"Revolutionary Love: Ferguson Uprising, A Love Story","Krause, Zoe",Political Science,2016,"Grattan, Laura","This thesis addresses the dimensions of what protestors in Ferguson refer to as ""revolutionary love,"" an affective force expressed and enacted in the streets. Answering the skepticism and dismissal of love in politics, I first examine the tradition of love in radical Black political thought, as well as somewhat more recent turns to love in feminist, queer and affect theory. Turning to diverse sources of coverage on protests against police brutality, including press coverage of Black Lives Matter the organization, the self-critical archive available via Ferguson activists' use of Twitter, and participant observation in protests in and around Ferguson, Missouri. Using both words and actions, I examine how movement actors define and use love in moments of uncertainty and risk. This love, I argue, has certain key components: constituting the movement, continuing the movement through certain practices (care labor and solidarity) and struggling in the face of both internal and external pressures. Moreover, it performs certain functions in linking protestors together in defiance of the white supremacist state."

I explore how an increase in education affects long-term health outcomes by exploiting the removal of the Social Security Student Benefit program in 1982 as an instrument for college attendance and completion in a two-stage least squares model. The outcomes of interest include likelihood of poor self-reported health, pain that interferes with work, arthritis, mental health, hypertension, heart problems, diabetes, smoking, and exercising. I am unable to reject increases or decreases in one's health outcomes or behaviors. My findings are inconclusive due to insufficient statistical power, which stems from a small sample size."

I was placed in the Department of Politique de la Ville, a national funding mechanism dedicated to low-income neighborhoods in France during its call to reform. At its best, the mechanism is quite dynamic, increasing the resources and mutual trust between residents and government; at its worst, it is highly ineffective, financially wasteful, and ignorant of the specific needs of communities. While most research students spend months piled over books, I spent months sitting in and listening to focus groups, community presentations, and internal department debates, a fly on the many walls of French bureaucracy and law making. This research experience played an important role in cementing my interest in urban conflict and, more importantly, was essential in my understanding of the give and take between local government and community organizing.

In the case of the contemporary Russian military, most scholars have attributed success in both Georgia (2008) and Crimea (2014) to a reformed and technologically improved military. Despite a widely accepted ""victory"" in Georgia, Russia's military performed disastrously, which catalyzed a series of reforms and modernization projects within the military. Many scholars have traced these reforms to the success of Russia's operations in Crimea in 2014, citing their superior technology and organizational learning. My thesis addresses the reality of Russia's military operation in Crimea, which I argue was dependent more on existing social collaborators, intelligence networks, and Russia's special operations forces, rather than an overwhelming conventional display of military force. I explore what we can learn about Russia's military from Crimea, and what other conditions would make possible a similarly structured military operation in future peripheral wars."

Architecture",2017,"Matthes, Erich Hatala","Why does architecture matter? Since the Western art tradition classifies architecture as a fine art alongside painting, sculpture, music, and literature, questions about architectural value are typically subsumed under more general questions about artistic value. Architecture, however, is fundamentally unlike the other fine arts. It is public, site-specific, functional, and immersed in everyday life, characteristics that challenge the applicability of a unified framework of art to architecture. My thesis examines the philosophical implications that arise when architecture is considered in isolation from the broader arts. I advance a theory of architectural value distinct from artistic value, which-with its emphasis on disinterestedness and contemplative attention-cannot account for all value-making features of architecture. I proceed to investigate two specific features of architecture that distinguish it from the other fine arts. First, I address architecture's functionality, and explain how knowing a building's function can alter the aesthetic qualities we perceive it to have. Second, I evaluate the moral questions that arise from architecture's status as a public art, addressing the obligations that publicness creates for architects and for members of architecture's audience. Ultimately, my thesis aims to bring architecture to the foreground of aesthetics-a field within which it has largely neglected-and introduce new perspectives on what architecture is and what makes it valuable."

In part due to the overwhelming status of her early essays, most notably ""Against Interpretation"" (1966) and ""Notes on Camp"" (1964), her work as a fiction writer - which she herself always maintained was her first life, her primary intellectual activity - has not received significant attention in the critical discourse. These fragments engage with various questions incited by her 1992 novel, The Volcano Lover, concerning the texture of narrative voice, historicity and referentiality, and the simultaneous deferral and satisfaction of desire. The novel is approached as a stage for the exploration of concerns raised and developed in the greater body of Sontag's work, and an argument is made for the complexity and worthiness of her fiction."

One such target was the United States. Americans from a variety of different social and political backgrounds were exposed to and drew influence from the ""Little Red Book,"" including academics who struggled to comprehend China's new role in the world, artists who used the Quotations' text in drama, and satirists who used the Quotations' unique style to lampoon or praise powerful figures.

93,"Voice, Silence, & Testimony: Recovering Feminist Voices in Italian Poetry and Autobiography","Yoke, Cynthia",Italian Studies,2017,"Ward, David","It is no secret nor a provocative assertion that men's voices, primarily white, European, have prevailed throughout history. These voices tend to represent the inventors, the geniuses, the colonizers, the conquerors, the artists, the poets, and other ""winners"" of history. They are voices so loud and so pervasive that they effectively drown out any evidence of an utterance made by a subordinate ""other."" But just because these voices and their narratives have been suppressed by the persistent noise of dominant institutions of power and their associated discourses does not mean that these voices cease to exist and to matter. In fact, it has been the mission of many contemporary feminist literary critics, working in a variety of ways and drawing on a variety of discursive spheres, to identify, recover, and remember female and minority voices. Scholars who have made it their life's work tread these texts within the context of a female literary tradition have found that women ""have influenced one another and written for and against each other for centuries"" (Marrone, 6). Two such critics cited in this thesis are Adriana Cavarero and Leigh Gilmore; while Cavarero offers a feminist reading of classic philosophical texts and concepts, Gilmore explores the construction and perception of autobiography as a genre and the subsequent ways women have been both included and excluded from the literary discipline. Both scholars are chiefly concerned, in notably different and interesting ways, with the the concept of female voice. Extending the arguments of Gilmore and Cavarero to the world of Italian poetry, it is possible to recover strong, creative, and female voices that have been silenced for centuries. Other texts and scholars referenced in this analysis will attempt to analyze the ways in which women have exercised agency, self expression, and political and social existence within genres that have traditionally disciplined forms of self-representation; in other words, this thesis will analyze not just what women are saying in their writing but also how they both work with and against conventional and disciplined forms in their attempt to offer life testimony. These texts, whether in the form of poetry or various types of autobiography, can and often have been for women a site of personal, social, and political resistance; in reading these texts with the objective of discovering a feminist voice, it is possible to identify and recognize moments in which Italian women, not merely and no longer passive recipients of oppression, actively reflect, anticipate, and create the various feminisms of their era."

96,The Heuristics of Obesity: Influences on Physician Decision-Making,"Caldwell, Marissa",Economics,2018,"Butcher, Kristin
McEwan, Patrick","Obesity status, which is based on arbitrary cutoffs along the BMI distribution, is a salient feature of medical charts and may be used heuristically by physicians to decide whether to test their patients for obesity-related diseases. Using nationally representative datasets and a regression discontinuity design, I explore whether there are differences in diagnosis and treatment outcomes among individuals very close to the obesity cutoff at BMI=30, assuming no underlying differences in health. I find evidence that women above the obesity threshold are significantly less likely to be told they are diabetic, have high blood pressure, or have coronary heart disease. Men just above the obesity threshold are more likely to be told they have a heart condition, but are less likely to report being advised by their physicians to change their behaviors to reduce risk of developing heart disease. These results suggest physicians use the obesity threshold heuristically, which could have detrimental implications for subsequent health outcomes: individuals below the threshold could be under-treated, while individuals above it may be over-treated. The prevalence and effects of heuristics in medicine should be investigated more thoroughly to improve physician-patient interactions and subsequent health outcomes."

Arumainayagam, Chris
Battat, James","Isotopes of the five stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) are useful in analyzing physical processes in the environment such as air-sea gas exchange and sea ice formation and melting. Traditional measurements of noble gases are costly and time-consuming because of the need to transport water samples to analyze in a laboratory-based mass spectrometer. Field deployable mass spectrometers were developed as a low-cost method to increase the temporal resolution of the measurements. Our system utilizes a quadrupole mass spectrometer in tandem with a gas equilibrator cartridge to continuously measure equilibrated gases from water with ambient air as a calibration standard. The reproducibility of the system is better than 0.7% for all gas ratios in a lab environment. However, our current configuration is not optimized for measuring helium because of the high permeability of helium through many of the materials used. Nonetheless, measuring helium will yield insight into quantifying bubble processes, which significantly affects rates of air-sea gas exchange. Our mass spectrometer configuration was thus extended to measure helium by switching from fused silica capillaries to stainless steel capillaries and switching from Tygon tubing to Viton tubing. The equilibration and precision of the new system was compared to that of the old configuration. Leak tests were performed on the old and new configuration to assess whether the leakiness of the system has improved. Results showed effective measurements of He with precisions better than 0.80% for both He/Ar and He/Kr at water temperatures of 22°C and above. Further optimization is needed to improve the equilibration of He and Ne at water temperatures of 10°C."
98,The Impact of Transportation Infrastructure on Firm Product Scope,"Chen, Mary",Economics,2018,"Abeberese, Ama Baafra","Highway and road networks are integral components of a developing economy's transportation infrastructure, facilitating trade and growth. Improvements in transportation infrastructure decrease trade costs, thereby affecting the choices firms make. One of these choices is firm product scope, or the number of products a firm makes, which can have implications for firm productivity. To evaluate the impact of an improvement in transportation infrastructure on the product scope of firms, I exploit an exogenous change in trade costs induced by the construction of the Golden Quadrilateral Project (GQP), a major highway network in India. I utilize a difference-in-differences model to analyze the effect of proximity to the highway on product scope for firms in the manufacturing sector. My main empirical finding is that proximity to the highway results in a decrease in product scope and an increase in productivity. I find suggestive evidence that the reduction in product scope can be explained through the competition channel, whereby the increase in competition caused by reduced trade costs induces firms to drop products that are produced less efficiently to remain competitive. This paper contributes to the empirical literature on the effects of trade costs on firm product scope and productivity."

To demonstrate the utility of the clavicle for behavioral reconstruction research, this study documents patterns of clavicular sexual dimorphism, directional asymmetry, and morphological variation to investigate the demographics of four medieval European populations."

101,Theatre as a paradigm: Chinese theatre as expressive and Western theatre as active,"Cui, Kendra",Theatre Studies,2018,"Rainer, Marta","This thesis is a comparative exploration of the different paradigms that Western and Chinese theatre-making and theatre-viewing are based on. In examining the paradigms of Western and Chinese theatre, various components of the theater-making and theatre-viewing experience are considered, including assumptions regarding what a theatrical experience should entail, expectations shared between creators and audiences, and the prevailing methodologies of theatrical creation that are used to fulfill these expectations. In executing this comparative analysis of Chinese and Western theatrical paradigms, this thesis is broken down into two main components: the first component consists of secondary research, which is used to inform the second component, a translation and performance of a Chinese theatrical text. The research component consists of-among other topics-an analysis of the poetics of each theatrical tradition, as well as an examination of cross-cultural interactions between Chinese and Western writers and theatre-makers. The translation-performance component consists of a translation from the original Chinese of He Peizhu's 梨花梦 (Pear Blossom Dream) into English, and a series of three stagings (in English) of excerpts from the text, with each staging guided by a specific theatrical paradigm. The results of both the research and performance components of this thesis demonstrate that Western theatre is a theatrical form that is primarily occupied with action, plot and verisimilitude, whereas Chinese theatre is a theatrical model that is concerned with expression of emotion through the achievement of a stylized, harmonious aesthetic."
102,"Keats, the ""Tongueless Nightingale,"" and the Legacy of Philomela in English Poetry","Whitlock, Windsor Rose",English,2018,"Hickey, Alison","In his groundbreaking essay, ""The Hoodwinking of Madeline,"" Jack Stillinger first posited a darker reading of Keats' The Eve of St. Agnes, arguing that Keats' mention in the poem of a ""tongueless nightingale"" is a calculated allusion to the story of Philomela from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Since Stillinger published his essay in 1961, not much else has been written on the subject, with the exception of Beverly Fields' 1983 article, ""Keats and the Tongueless Nightingale: Some Unheard Melodies in 'The Eve of St. Agnes.' "" In this essay, Fields suggests that Keats killed off the ""tongueless nightingale"" at the conclusion of The Eve of St. Agnes and thus divorced the nightingale from its association with Philomela when the bird reappears in Keats' ode. This thesis largely argues against Fields' interpretation by taking a closer look at the Ovidian myth and its subsequent legacy in the English poetic canon to consider, from a feminist lens, how Keats inherits and re-engages with the myth. For much of the history of English literature, all the English poets of the canon were to some degree Classicists. Even Keats, who was ridiculed by contemporary critics for his Enfield education and his inability to read Greek, would have read Ovid. Therefore Chapter One, 'Classical Contexts,' returns to the Classical myth of Philomela and its context in Ovid's Metamorphoses to look at significant themes of the story and theories of approaching it. Then in Chapter Two, 'Lines of Influence,' I turn to Keats' ""tongueless nightingale"" in The Eve of St. Agnes and his engagement with Shakespeare's (as well as Ovid's) Philomel in that poem. Finally, in the third chapter I move to ""Ode to a Nightingale"" as well as the poem most directly in conversation with it - ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" - to consider how Philomel might resurface in this second nightingale of Keats' and what meaning(s) could be gained by searching for her echoes here."
103,Multi-Label Super Learner: Multi-Label Classification and Improving Its Performance Using Heterogenous Ensemble Methods,"Wu, Yujue",Mathematics,2018,"Wang, Qing","Classification is the task of predicting the label(s) of future instances by learning and inferring from the patterns of instances with known labels. Traditional classification methods focus on single-label classification; however, many real-life problems require multi-label classification that classifies each instance into multiple categories. For example, in sentiment analysis, a person may feel multiple emotions at the same time; in bioinformatics, a gene or protein may have a number of functional expressions; in text categorization, an email, medical record, or social media posting can be identified by various tags simultaneously. As a result of such wide a range of applications, in recent years, multi-label classification has become an emerging research area. There are two general approaches to realize multi-label classification: problem transformation and algorithm adaption. The problem transformation methodology, at its core, converts a multi-label dataset into several single-label datasets, thereby allowing the transformed datasets to be modeled using existing binary or multi-class classification methods. On the other hand, the algorithm adaption methodology transforms single-label classification algorithms in order to be applied to original multi-label datasets. This thesis proposes a new method, called Multi-Label Super Leaner (MLSL), which is a stacking-based heterogeneous ensemble method. An improved multi-label classification algorithm following the problem transformation approach, MLSL combines the prediction power of several multi-label classification methods through an ensemble algorithm, super learner. The performance of this new method is compared to existing problem transformation algorithms, and our numerical results show that MLSL outperforms existing algorithms for almost all of the performance metrics."
104,Luck or Skill: How Women and Men Attribute Successes and Failures,"Xia, Lingjun",Economics,2018,"Shurchkov, Olga
Shastry, Kartini","There is a consensus in economics that a significant gender gap in competitiveness exists, which contributes to substantial gender difference in economic outcomes. Our study uses a controlled online experiment to explore a potential explanatory variable for gender gaps in tournament entry, namely, the gender difference in attribution of feedback. We find that, upon receiving negative feedback, women attribute it to lack of ability, regardless of what self-evaluation they hold initially. On the other hand, men blame bad luck for negative feedback that challenges their positive self-evaluation, and only blame their own ability if their self-evaluation was pessimistic in the first place. We also find that feedback eliminates the gender difference in tournament entry, confirming previous work. The elimination of the gap is mostly attributable to the fact that low-performing men are less likely to enter competition upon receiving feedback. Despite a substantial difference in attribution patterns, we cannot conclude, with our current data, whether feedback attribution is a major explanatory variable for the gender gap in competitiveness."
105,Implementing simultaneous calcium imaging and optogenetics in freely moving rodents to investigate the role of local inhibition in place field stability,"Yan, Helena",Neuroscience,2018,"Wasserman, Sara
Wilson, Matthew A.
Wiest, Michael C.","Place cells are pyramidal neurons in CA1, 2, and 3 of the hippocampus that fire preferentially when an animal is located in a certain position in an environment. The location to which a place cell maximally responds (its place field) is randomly assigned within an environment. Place fields can be re-assigned depending on changes to local sensory cues within an environment, a phenomenon called ""remapping"". Research has established that place field formation is affected by input from the local network in the hippocampus. Interneurons in CA1 are known to provide inhibitory input into place cells, but no causal link between local inhibition and place map remapping has been demonstrated. Here, we sought to understand if directly driving local inhibitory networks in CA1 could induce place field remapping. To do this, we used optogenetic stimulation to excite interneurons while concurrently monitoring neural activity using a red-shifted calcium indicator (jRCaMP1b) in freely moving mice. Microendoscopic calcium imaging was performed over multiple days as the mouse explored an open field. After the animal had explored the field for several days, interneurons in CA1 were optogenetically activated at certain positions in the environment. Unfortunately, the low signal to noise level of the red-shifted calcium indicator prevented analysis of this dataset. In lieu of this, we analyzed data from a green fluorescent calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) that we used to initially test out our experimental technique. The results of this analysis revealed aberrant neural activity during calcium imaging sessions, suggesting that the calcium imaging technique may have unexpected, pathological effects on neural activity in the hippocampus. The work described here sets the groundwork for further concurrent use of optogenetics with calcium imaging in investigations into the cellular mechanisms behind place field formation."
106,Evaluation of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Approaches: Dynamic Binary Translation vs. Dynamic Probe Injection,"Zhao, Valerie",Computer Science,2018,"Wood, Benjamin P.","From web browsing to bank transactions, to data analysis and robot automation, just about any task necessitates or benefits from the use of software. Ensuring a piece of software to be effective requires profiling the program's behavior to evaluate its performance, debugging the program to fix incorrect behaviors, and examining the program to detect security flaws. These tasks are made possible by instrumentation---the method of inserting code into a program to collect data about its behavior. Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) enables programmers to understand and reason about program behavior by inserting code into a binary during run time to collect relevant data, and is more flexible than static or source-code instrumentation, but incurs run-time overhead. This thesis attempts to extend the preexisting characterization of the tradeoffs between dynamic binary translation (DBT) and dynamic probe injection (DPI), two popular DBI approaches, using Pin and LiteInst as sample frameworks. It also describes extensions to the LiteInst framework that enable it to instrument function exits correctly. This evaluation involved using the two frameworks to instrument a set of SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks for counting function entries alone, counting both function entries and exits, or dynamically generating a call graph. On these instrumentation tasks, Pin performed close to native binary time while LiteInst performed significantly slower. Exceptions to this observation, and analysis of the probe types used by LiteInst, suggest that LiteInst incurs significant overhead when executing a large number of probes."

Lewis, Laura","Previous research has demonstrated that sleep spindles (11-17 Hz), which are known to be important for memory consolidation, and occipital alpha rhythms (8 - 11 Hz), which are suggested to play a role in inhibiting visual processing, are modulated by the thalamus; however, it is unclear how the relationship between the thalamus and these oscillations differs between wake and sleep. We recruited nine human subjects to undergo simultaneous EEG-fMRI data collection at 3T to investigate the dynamics of thalamo-cortical circuits. EEG data was scored to identify epochs of wake, stage 1, and stage 2 sleep, and pulvinar and mediodorsal nuclei were manually labeled in each subject. For each sleep stage, we calculated the temporal correlation between occipital alpha power and BOLD signals from the primary visual area (V1) as well as the pulvinar and mediodorsal nuclei; additionally, we measured the correlation between frontal spindle power and BOLD signals from the pulvinar and mediodorsal nuclei. Although we did not find any significant changes regarding spindle power, we found that the correlation between occipital alpha power and V1 BOLD activity was significantly negative in wake, and became significantly less negative during stage 2 sleep compared to wake. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between occipital alpha power and BOLD activity in the pulvinar nucleus became more positive in stage 2 sleep compared to both wake and stage 1 sleep, and was significantly positive during stage 2 sleep. Finally, we found that the correlations between occipital alpha power and BOLD signals from the mediodorsal vs. pulvinar nuclei were significantly different during wake. Therefore, our study is the first to identify focal thalamic circuit activity in the human brain associated with cortical rhythms during sleep. In addition, our results suggest that the neural circuits that regulate visual processing during wake become altered during sleep. Future studies should further investigate how the dynamics of other thalamic nuclei may also differ during wake vs. sleep."

Watters, Wesley Andrés","This thesis introduces the ""adVantage - Seeing the Universe"" system, a learning environment designed to augment introductory undergraduate astronomy education. The goal of the adVantage project is to show how an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment can be used effectively to model the relative sizes and distances between objects in space. To this end, adVantage leverages the benefits of three-dimensional models by letting users observe astronomical phenomena from multiple locations. The system uses pre-set vantage points to structure students' progress through a ""mission"" designed to improve their understanding of scale. With this first mission, adVantage demonstrates the potential benefits of representing larger distances as multiples of smaller steps of a constant and observable size to convey relative distance in space, and of judging relative size by making observations at various vantage points a constant distance away from each other. Using an HTC Vive headset and hand-controllers, students exploring in adVantage will be able to observe the relative sizes and orbital movements of the subjects of the system: e.g., the exoplanet WASP-12b, its Sun-like star, WASP-12, and imagined satellites constructed to resemble the Earth and its Moon. In the first mission, users investigate the Earth's average orbital radius around the Sun with the average orbital radius of WASP-12b around WASP-12 as a yardstick."

In contemporary Indian society, mental health has been a rising problem in the homosexual community, with more and more queer individuals suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation. This paper connects the problem of declining mental health in the queer community to three main factors: Indian laws affecting the queer community, British colonialism of India, and the religion of Hinduism. It tries to understand the impact that each of these factors had on the mental health status of the Indian queer community by referring to past research, as well as getting the perspective of seven interviewees who either work in LGBTQIA related NGOs, or serve as LGBTQIA activists. This paper concluded that British colonialism had a considerable impact on the mental health status of queer people living in India today, by shaping Indian law, as well as the perception of sexuality in the public domain. In terms of Indian law, homophobic legislation such as Section 377 and the Criminal Tribes Act criminalized the behaviors and identities of sexual minorities, thereby leading to a history of queer persecution. However, Hinduism did not play much of a role in affecting the treatment or mental status of the queer community in modern day India."

During the eight years that the group was active, the Ratgeb Collective worked with squatters, school children, teenage runaways, immigrant minorities, juvenile delinquents and even a biker gang to create more than a dozen large-scale murals within Berlin. Eleven of these murals can still be seen today, nearly four decades after their creation. My thesis focuses on both Ratgeb's commissioned and illegal mural projects, all of which comment on the housing crisis that arose in the 1980s following the retail speculation government officials had organized with foreign investors. The namesake of the group, and honorary sixth member, Jörg Ratgeb was an altar and fresco painter who regularly infused his religious paintings with messages of political dissent, and was later executed due to his leadership role in the Farmer's uprising. In honor of this early fellow German artist and activist, the Collective Ratgeb adopted not only his name but his revolutionary drive to use murals as a means of communicating the wants and needs of those civilians that had been overlooked and neglected by government officials and the social elite of West Berlin."

Once transported into cells adjacent to the synapse, glutamate can be metabolized into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) or glutamine. Since GLT deletions are often lethal in mammals, C. elegans were used to investigate the role of GLTs on metabolism and aging in this thesis. The lifespans of C. elegans GLT-knockouts (GLT-1;GLT-3, GLT-4, and GLT-5) were measured and compared to wildtype worms. A well-established method involving FUdR, a chemical that prevents egg-laying in C. elegans, was used to conduct the lifespan experiments. Results indicated that GLT-4 mutants had shorter lifespans, GLT-5 mutants had longer lifespans, and GLT-1;GLT-3 mutants had similar lifespan lengths compared to wildtype worms. Despite being the primary method for aging experiments in C. elegans, FUdR is costly and hazardous. We pursued an alternative lifespan technique using mesh-well plates to separate C. elegans from their laid eggs. While the mesh-well technique had multiple theoretical advantages, this technique did not consistently separate adult worms from laid-eggs. To determine the influence of glutamate metabolism on the lifespan differences between strains, we refined a protocol to analyze the levels of glutamine, glutamate, and α-KG metabolites using ¹H-NMR. While NMR could not be used to measure metabolite levels in C. elegans samples, metabolite experiments are on-going. These findings bring us closer to understanding how the effects of glutamate metabolism in cellular respiration and neurotransmission influence aging."

DeSombre, Beth
Jones, Kristina","Fertilizers provide nitrogen to agricultural crops, which is often the nutrient limiting plant growth. However, synthetic fertilizers are often not preferred or possible sources of soil nutrients due to economic and ecological reasons. Agroecological practices have historically incorporated legumes and mulching into agroecosystems to improve productivity. This research investigated the effects of legume mulching on small scale vegetable crop productivity. The experiment was conducted in the Wellesley College Edible Ecosystem Garden in 24 replicate barrel collars. In each barrel, I planted two spinach (Spinacia oleracea, variety 'Tyee') and two lettuce (Lactuca sativa, variety 'Romaine') plants. In half of the barrels, I incorporated the dried biomass of crown vetch (Securigera varia), a nitrogen-fixing plant, as a mulch, with the goal of adding nitrogen to the soil as a treatment group. I hypothesized that decreased nutrient deficiency would lead to increased plant productivity by increasing soil inorganic nitrogen content, increasing aboveground plant biomass and above to belowground biomass ratio, and increasing soil respiration rates in the treatment group. Inorganic nitrogen levels increased post-experiment in all barrels. They were higher in the treatment group soils post-experiment, significantly so for nitrate (NO3-). This supports the hypothesis that nutrient deficiency would decrease in the treatment group. The aboveground biomass, and subsequently the above to belowground biomass ratio, was lower in the treatment group. These results are likely due to preferential herbivory of treatment plants due to higher nutrients. The effects on ecosystem feedbacks, namely respiration, did not show significant differences between control and treatment groups, and so the null hypothesis could not be rejected. I conclude that while further research is needed, results support that crown vetch as a legume mulch increases increases soil nitrogen, and likely increases productivity."
119,Modeling the Earth-Moon Distance for Different Theories of Gravitation,"Rose, Sanaea",Astrophysics,2017,"Battat, James","Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) measures the transit time of a laser pulse from an observatory on Earth to corner cube retroreflectors on the Moon, installed by Apollo astronauts and Russian rovers. A transit time measurement with 7 ps precision gives the Earth-Moon distance with millimeter precision. Successive measurements indicate the evolution of this distance and can constrain theories of gravitation. These theories include General Relativity (GR), which remains incompatible with Quantum Mechanics. This project presents simulations of the Earth-Moon-Sun system in Python that focus solely on the physics of gravitation and provide a means of comparing the evolution of the Earth-Moon distance for different gravitational frameworks. The comparisons thus far have focused on violations of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) using a quasi-Newtonian formulation of gravitation. The comparisons between the Newtonian and quasi-Newtonian frameworks take two approaches. The first involves subtracting simulated Newtonian Earth-Moon distances from simulated SEP violation Earth-Moon distances and analyzing the results using a Fourier transform, which identifies periodic signals. The Fourier spectrum revealed an SEP violation signal as well as three other signals related to the Sun's perturbation of the Earth-Moon system and the eccentricity of the lunar orbit. However, this method is not ideal because the rate of precession of the lunar orbit depends on the degree of SEP violation, or lack thereof. The more optimal, second approach consists of fitting SEP violation simulated data with a Newtonian model. The post-fit residuals should be dominated by the SEP violation signal. The results were varied: the SEP violation signal dominated some of the post-fit residuals, while in some fits with different initial conditions, the other periodic signals persisted. The reasons for this inconsistency remain unclear. Because of correlations between parameters, the model was able to absorb some of the SEP violation signal by adjusting parameters like the initial velocities and positions of the objects. However, all fits failed to fully mask the SEP violation, indicating that LLR is sensitive to an SEP violation. Future work may focus on optimizing the fit and increasing its accuracy, and on undertaking similar comparisons for GR and alternative theories."

Before the rise of oxygenic phototrophs 2.3 billion years ago, microbes utilized anoxygenic photosynthesis to form organic carbon compounds using electron donors such as iron [Fe(II)] and reduced sulfur compounds. Anoxygenic phototrophs can be found in modern environments like meromictic lakes. We studied enrichment cultures of microorganisms driven by anoxygenic photosynthesis to determine whether and how they use another possible electron donor, manganese [Mn(II)]. Cultures reduced with sulfide [H2S] and enriched with Mn(II) as a potential electron donor oxidized Mn(II) and formed various manganese oxide minerals in the presence of light. To further characterize these anaerobic microbial communities and the role of manganese, we grew the cultures on different concentrations of Mn(II) and H2S and isolated individual microbes. We characterized the composition of the microbial communities by extracting copies of a specific gene, 16S rRNA, which is highly conserved and a standard species-identifying marker. Communities grew only in the presence of light and obligately anaerobic green sulfur bacteria from the phylum Chlorobi were the only phototrophic organisms. From these communities, we identified several taxa using 16S rRNA gene and whole genome sequencing; most notably, a taxon belonging to Chlorobi identified as Chlorobium limicola and a taxon belonging to Desulfomicrobium identified as Desulfomicrobium baculatum. We found a robust microbial community capable of oxidizing Mn(II) in the absence of molecular oxygen. These communities are driven by anoxygenic photosynthesis and dependent on the concentration of sulfur sources, like sulfide. Optimal conditions for anaerobic oxidation of Mn(II) suggest this process occurs in source environment."

One such operation, APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has achieved millimeter precision measurements of the Earth-Moon distance, allowing for 10 times more stringent constraints of gravitational parameters. Until recently, however, there was no way to assess the measurement ac- curacy. In order to test gravitational models with greater accuracy, APOLLO implemented the Absolute Calibration System (ACS), an internal calibration laser, which pulses light at a frequency stable at the part per trillion level. My thesis research centered around making improvements to one component of the ACS, the Laser Slicer Board (LSB), which acts as a very fast ON/OFF gate for light from the ACS calibration laser. In preparation for this work, I redesigned the Opto-isolation and Tiltmeter Board (opto-tilt board) for APOLLO, replacing a previous opto-isolation board that had not been electrically functioning and combining it with an accelerometer-based tiltmeter to conserve space. After developing the schematic and layout of this board, I populated, tested, and installed the board at Apache Point Observatory in January 2017. As a theoretical exercise, I also took advantage of the time measurements from APOLLO's two clocks - one GPS-disciplined to behave as if it were at sea level and the other counting time at an altitude of 2.8 km - to explore the phenomena of Gravitational Redshift and its effects on measuring time."

The Topological Tverberg Conjecture states that any continuous map f: Δ^N --> R^d has r-fold self-intersections such that the preimages of the r-fold intersection points come from pairwise disjoint faces in the original simplex. F. Frick recently announced a counterexample to the conjecture for d ≥ 3r+1, when r is not a power of a prime. This thesis will discuss an alternative analysis of Frick's counterexample using the manifold calculus of functors. We hope that this technique will provide insight into other counterexamples to the Topological Tverberg Conjecture."

In reality, however, imperial control in the 18th-century British West Indies was neither as obvious nor as secure as these canvases may suggest at first glance. New theories on nationhood, economic and social organization, and human difference produced ill-fitting and incoherent conceptions of empire. The Anglo-French War was fought in Caribbean waters, local merchants lobbying for free trade endangered British national industry, and the threat of conflict between indigenous peoples, Africans, and Europeans was an ever-present reality. There is a need, therefore, to recuperate a history of instability and revise our narratives of successful imperial conquest in the colonial Caribbean. Brunias's market scenes, The Linen Market, Santo Domingo, A Linen Market with a Linen-stall and Vegetable Seller, Market Day, Roseau, Dominica, and Linen Market, Dominica, which are at once images of civility and prosperity in the Caribbean, allow us to explore the various readings of resistance and contestation back into 18th-century history."

Radhakrishnan, Mala L.","Gas flux at high wind speeds is not fully understood, and bubbles are rarely accounted for in models of air-sea gas exchange. Observing noble gas fluxes under bubble-rich and high wind conditions provides needed insight into fundamental gas exchange laws. The noble gases are ideal tracers for measuring gas exchange because they are inert and only respond to physical forcing; their range of physical properties results in unique responses to environmental changes for each gas. To quantify the effect of physical processes on gas fluxes, we took discrete and continuous measurements of noble gas ratios at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science's SUrge STructure Atmospheric InteractioN (SUSTAIN) wind-wave tank. Over five days of experiments, we implemented 10-meter (U10) equivalent wind speeds ranging from 10-36 m s-1, water temperatures ranging from 18 to 27.5 degrees Celsius, and wave conditions including regularly breaking waves, irregularly breaking waves, and waves targeted to break at our sampling location. We used a Gas Equilibration Mass Spectrometer (GEMS) system to continuously measure noble gas ratios (with Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe), with a temporal resolution of ~15 minutes, during the experiments. The GEMS was calibrated using cold-welded copper tube discrete samples, which also yield concentrations of the noble gases, including helium. Bubbles were imaged during the experiments with a submerged shadowgraph, and physical parameters such as short-scale surface roughness, wave amplitude and water velocity were continuously monitored. Although the SUSTAIN tank cannot truly replicate oceanic processes, we can use the data to make direct links between physical conditions and gas fluxes. These links should prove useful to increasing our mechanistic understanding of air-sea gas exchange and improving gas transfer parameterizations, especially for bubble-rich and high wind conditions."

As players want to find others to game with consistently, online communities have formed out of necessity. Through interactions with the men and women, e-boys and e-girls, on one such community, I have come to observe persisting and rigid norms regarding gender performance and interaction. Even though people have the ability to be whomever, whatever gender or age, they want through the anonymity of the internet, those in the community choose to not only reveal their gender and conform to gender performances not unlike those described in Deborah Tannen's ""You Just Don't Understand."" Instead of participating in identity play, members choose to reproduce existing norms in the offline world. Additionally, I explore those that intentionally, and unintentionally, challenge these norms within the community such as Catfishers, those that hide their gender or identity for profit, Transgender members, those that cannot be categorized under the current heteronormative structure of the online community."

Although France withdrew from NATO in 1966, and President Richard Nixon publicly claimed that the U.S. would act as the ""nuclear umbrella,"" the Nixon administration initiated a secret nuclear assistance program of information sharing on ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons technology, and nuclear weapons safety to the French government. Given that atomic assistance inadvertently raises the likelihood of nuclear proliferation, the current literature suggests that nuclear assistance should be a rare occurrence and thus fails to provide a compelling explanation for why, and under what condition, a state may be willing to offer nuclear assistance to an ally. Through an examination of archival and secondary sources, I argue that the U.S. formulated its nuclear assistance policy to France in response to particular opportunities and incentives that were connected more to bilateral relations with France at the time than theories related to the threat or normative environment. This thesis challenges the current literature's expectations and calls for a new analytical approach towards understanding the dynamics of nuclear assistance."

This thesis will present three comparative case studies-hospitality narratives, flood narratives, and creation narratives-each of which will utilize a structuralist methodology. In each chapter, the structure of each version of the umbrella myth will be diagrammed in relation to each other. The diagrams are tabular, and schematize the individual narrative functions that comprise each umbrella myth-type in a highly abstracted form. This visualization allows the reader to clearly see the role each function plays within its respective narrative context, but also how it compares to other instances of the same function. Through the use of this structuralist approach two things become clear. The first being that although each of the episodes studied is familiar, and recognizable as an instantiation of the umbrella myth (i.e., hospitality, flood, or creation), close text-focused study has demonstrated that these iterations are actually quite different. The second discovery is that these differences are not at all random. The focused, tabular-based study of the mythic episodes reveals the manifold ways that different authors purposefully manipulated and organized narrative functions, the building blocks of myths. Each author's alterations and patterning was influenced by external societal, cultural, and ideological forces, among others. It is only through a structuralist study that the intricate diachronic and synchronic relational web becomes evident, thus enriching the reader's understanding of each respective text."

While the order of magnitude of the epidemic is similar across the region, and the states share similar features of their economies, demographics, and a regional identity and history, different policy responses to this devastating public health crisis have emerged. This thesis first examines the science of opioids and the history of how the opioid addiction epidemic began and grew, and details the differences in policy responses across the New England States. Why and how have these differences emerged? I ask what role governors prioritization of the opioid addiction epidemic in state of the state and budget addresses plays in shaping the budget allocation for the agency responsible for substance abuse treatment. I conclude that governor prioritization of the opioid issue has a positive impact on the percentage of the budget allocated to the substance abuse treatment agency, but only for budget addresses."

While Carter remained committed to arms control, he ultimately strengthened the damage limitation strategy laid out in the Nixon administration, pushing the U.S. toward nuclear modernization and an increased reliance on nuclear weapons. Why did the Carter administration adopt this strategy necessitating nuclear superiority? Using qualitative analysis of newspapers, private memos, and public government documents, I find conventional explanations of Carter's policy downplay the prominent domestic debates about nuclear strategy during this time. Drawing on theories of agenda setting and legitimation in national security, I argue Carter shifted his strategy partly because coalitions legitimated alternative policies and successfully mobilized against his initial vision. The tension between weapons modernization and arms control pervades the development of U.S. nuclear policy; this work suggests contradictions in U.S. nuclear strategy reflect contestation between domestic elites trying to frame their desired policy as the optimal deterrence strategy."

144,Application of Bayesian Inference to Analysis of Dynamic Light Scattering Data to Determine Particle Size Distributions,"Martin, Caroline",Physics,2018,"Fung, Jerome","Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a technique used to determine the size distribution of particles suspended in a fluid, that undergo Brownian motion through random collision with the molecules of the fluid. When light is incident on the suspension, each particle scatters the light, creating a complex interference pattern that randomly fluctuates in time as the particles move. Over long periods of time, we can use these flunctuations in the measured intensity of light to determine the composition of the sample. This thesis develops and tests a Bayesian inference approach to this problem. The Bayesian approach to statistics describes probability as a degree of belief, and incorporates prior information about the system into the inference. Recently, Bayesian inference has been incorporated into other fields with limited data sets, such as astronomy, and other techniques in soft matter, such as holographic microscopy; some preliminary efforts have been made to apply this to dynamic light scattering. This thesis expands on these efforts, and develops an open source algorithm in Python that is able to efficiently and accurately describe the size distribution of particles in a nearly monodisperse suspension with a mono-modal size distribution. This algorithm is tested on several sets of DLS; while these results are promising, further testing will need to be done before a conclusion can be drawn about the precision of this method compared to the traditional least squares fit. The results of this thesis do indicate that Bayesian inference provides comparable results to the traditional least squares fit, with additional information provided about the system in the probability density function for the inferred parameters."

146,"From Tokyo to Boston, Brazil, Britain, and Beyond: How Japanese Religious Movement Soka Gakkai International Adapted to a 21st-Century World","Regalado, Arianna",Religion,2018,"Kodera, James","My religion honors thesis examines the roots of Nichiren Buddhism in Japan, founded by Japanese Buddhist monk Nichiren Daishonin (1222-1282) in the 13th century. I explain how this branch of Mahayana Buddhism has managed not only to survive over hundreds of years but grow, branching out overseas from Japan and amassing millions of followers from Brazil to Boston. Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren was born in 1222 in the Chiba Prefecture of Japan and lived during the Kamakura period of 1185-1333. He is known for his emphasis on the study of the Buddhist sacred text, the Lotus Sutra, as the sole method for attaining enlightenment. Based on his teachings, Nichiren Buddhism was formed as a branch of Mahayana Buddhism. In modern-day Japan, Nichiren Buddhism encompasses traditional schools and modern lay movements like Soka Gakkai. Soka Gakkai, a Japanese Buddhist religious movement and the largest of the Nichiren Buddhist groups, has grown to a membership of more than 12 million in 192 countries worldwide since its inception in 1930. Part of my thesis examines Nichiren and critique his interpretations of the Lotus Sutra as the most crucial component of achieving enlightenment. I critically analyze the evolution of Nichiren Buddhism and its development as a branch of Mahayana Buddhism through the vehicle of Soka Gakkai International as the largest Nichiren Buddhist group. While the bulk of the literature exploring Nichiren Buddhism and Soka Gakkai has been written about the early 20th century and focuses on the early beginnings of Soka Gakkai's success solely in Japan, my thesis will also include analysis on the modern-day movement around the world. From the creation of Soka University in Malibu, California to Soka Gakkai International branches located in the United Kingdom, Soka Gakkai has made a tremendous effort to appeal to a vast number of the global population, particularly young, college-aged groups, in order to sustain the movement long-term. My thesis examines Soka Gakkai's foundations in Japan as well as how the organization expanded globally by looking at their branches in the United Kingdom, Brazil, Italy, Singapore, and Boston and by answering the following pertinent questions: how has Soka Gakkai International been successful in recruiting and adapting to a modern audience spanning over 100 countries? Does Soka Gakkai's enormous power and influence in the political, economic, and social spheres globally hinder the true message of Nichiren Buddhism as a Mahayana tradition focused on worldly renunciation? If so, is this the kind of compromise the movement has had to make in order to survive and thrive in a 21st century world? What other compromises has the organization made in the quest for more followers? In my thesis, I analyze how this religious organization developed and molded itself for a dynamic audience in order to survive. What changes or compromises, if any, did this religious institution have to make in order to thrive in this world? What can we learn from the way this institution developed in order to fit people's contemporary lives? What messages are lost (or gained) in this modern translation of religious sacred texts like the Lotus Sutra? In order to formulate a strong thesis, I analyzed statistical data on the demographics of Soka Gakkai's membership over time. I also conducted fieldwork at Soka Gakkai International New England Chapter, located in Brookline, Massachusetts. Additionally, I participated in the Ikeda Center for Peace, Learning, and Dialogue seminars on nuclear abolition in order to assess whether the modern-day practices and educational institutions align with the 13th century Nichiren teachings. With a balance of recent sources, such as the aforementioned qualitative statistical data on member demographics, fieldwork, personal accounts of Soka Gakkai practices, and scholarly texts, such as academic literature and Nichiren works, I present the strategies Soka Gakkai International utilized in order to amass a following for Nichiren."
147,"""Not Just a White Woman's Disease"": Radicalizing Eating Disorder Knowledge","Riobueno-Naylor, Alexa",Sociology,2018,"Rutherford, Markella","Eating disorder knowledge is dominated by a homogenous perspective largely devoid of racial or cultural diversity. Dialogues about what it means to be a woman and what it means to have an eating disorder have historically been singularly situated within the bodies of white women. These predominantly white narratives have served as the foundation for research studies on eating disorders which have shaped knowledge related to eating disorder diagnosis and treatment. By comparing the narratives of black (n=20), white (n=23), and Latina (n=15) women with eating disorders as well as incorporating perspectives from fifteen clinicians who treat eating disorders, this thesis investigates how the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders is reflective of white-dominated epistemological eating disorder frameworks which further marginalize women of color with eating disorders who interact with institutions of psychology and medicine. Eating disorder diagnostic criteria, as defined by psychological and medical expertise, are evaluated and compared to details shared by women about their eating disorder experiences. New knowledges about eating disorders according to the words of Latina and black women are proposed, integrating women's individual psychological experiences into the collective social and cultural experiences that inform women of color's eating disorders. The relationship between heterogeneous eating disorder knowledge and treatment accessibility is also discussed. This thesis concludes that in order for black and Latina women to access more equitable eating disorder diagnosis and treatment, the impact that collective social marginalization has on individual bodies must be integrated into clinical and academic knowledge related to eating disorders."

Johnson, Jenny","This paper explores connections between social justice and music through the work of LGBT and queer musicians. Using a combination of personal interviews and research, each chapter highlights contemporary queer musicians and links their musicking with past music scenes, sociohistorical moments, and musicians. Beginning with the growing visibility of the LGBT population in the 1960s, I gradually move forward chronologically through the twentieth century to present-day, grounding the music scene of the era within the context of coinciding LGBT and queer politics, gender and sexuality academia, and feminist and queer theory. I simultaneously link each music scene to the present-day, offering examples of its legacy in contemporary queer music, and comparing the social justice work of today with the work of past decades. Using a matrix that examines the functions of musicking within social movements and how they connect with queer musicians' modes of engagement, this paper delves into the value of musicking within a broader transformative social justice framework, and seeks to articulate ways in which music might contribute to social justice. More specifically, this work considers the unique role of queer musicians within contemporary social justice initiatives and considers the ways in which queer musicians might best engage in today's transformative social justice framework. —Keywords: Queer theory, Gender identity, Feminist theory, Homosexuality and music, Gay musicians, Social movements"
158,Redefining the L1: Can Vowel Categories Change?,"Kim, Yoolim",Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,2012,"Carpenter, Angela C.","I study the phenomenon of errors produced by Korean-English bilinguals in both their first and second languages (L1 and L2). Research has demonstrated that such errors are often due to differences in available phonemes and phonotactic constraints in languages (Flege 1995), or because certain phonological processes in one language are transferred into pronunciations in the L2 (Tsukada et al., 2005). However, these reasons do not account for pronunciation errors in the L1. To study these errors in the L1 and L2, I recorded eleven Korean-English bilinguals (all of Korean descent) reading Korean and English passages. I analyzed vowel production and focused on the production of ""constructed"" vowels. I posit that these ""constructed"" vowels result from partially developed phonemes collapsing to form one sound specific to the individual. My findings demonstrate that certain groups of Korean-English bilinguals demonstrate incomplete acquisition of both L1 and L2 phonologies, and thus combine two incomplete phonetic inventories to form one complete, idiosyncratic phonemic inventory, one that is neither fully characteristic of either the L1 or L2, but still contains sounds from both. In sum, I found there to be an overall trend of clustering English vowels and a general shifting of Korean vowels, marked by increased backness. I call upon a more comprehensive model such that both directions - the effects of L1 on L2 as well as the effects of L2 on L1 - can be accounted. Ultimately, my study shows that, regardless of the state of bilingualism, all vowels are prone to change. —Keywords: Vowels, Comparative and general Grammar -- Phonology, Second language acquisition -- Phonetics"
159,The Development of Kaji Kito in Nichiren Shu Buddhism,"Igarashi, Kyomi J.",Religion,2012,"Kodera, T. James","While the historical and religious roots of kaji kito (""ritual prayer"") lay in Indian and Chinese Esoteric Buddhist practices, the most direct influence of kaji kito in Nichiren Shu Buddhism, a Japanese Buddhist sect founded by the Buddhist monk, Nichiren (1222-1282), comes from Shingon and Tendai Buddhism, two traditions that precede Nichiren's time. The historical development and initial incorporation of kaji kito into Nichiren Buddhism suggest that the main objective was to bring happiness to people through the use of prayer. Analysis of kaji kito following the death of Nichiren has shown that although different methods of kaji kito have developed, this notion of bringing happiness has been maintained. Changes made to the kaji kito of Nichiren Buddhism will be explained along with a discussion of the physical practice of kaji kito called aragyo, a 100-day ascetic practice undergone annually in Japan by some Nichiren Shu priests. —Keywords: Nichiren (Sect) -- Customs and practices, Prayer -- Buddhism"
160,How Do Government Mortgage Programs Affect Low-Income Neighborhoods,"Johnson, Tessa",Economics,2012,"Fetter, Daniel","This paper investigates the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), a government policy encouraging mortgage lending to low-to-moderate income areas, on mortgage lending and community outcomes in the targeted areas. I exploit the cutoff regulators used to determine if a tract has low-to-moderate income to examine the impact of the policy through a regression discontinuity. Using data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the 1990 Census, I find that CRA has an effect of about 5.4% on the number of originations for 1994-1999 in large MSA's. Additionally, I examine the effect of CRA on community outcome variables using data from the 2000 Census: homeownership, median home values, mobility, high school degree attainment, college degree attainment, employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, labor force participation, and commuting time. I find that there is little evidence of significant effects of CRA on the community outcome variables. I also conduct an IV test to examine the effect of the increase on mortgage supply on the community outcomes; similar to the reduced form results, I find little evidence of a significant large effect. —Keywords: United States.

Some theories in evolutionary biology provide compelling explanations for why it is more crucial for men than for women to be funny. I offer an alternative sociolinguistic perspective on the formation of this divide that focuses on the frequent association of women with a less powerful speech style, and how it may be changing. I investigated responses to jokes told by men and women using powerful and powerless styles. Hypothesis 1 was that jokes attributed to male speakers would receive higher ratings of competence, influence, and funniness than those attributed to women. Hypothesis 2 predicted that speakers using powerless language would receive lower ratings on the three attributes than those using powerful language, except for female speakers, who would receive higher ratings (Carli, 1990; Parton et al., 2002). As a reflection of possible changes over time in perception of powerless speech, Hypothesis 3 predicted that older participants would give lower ratings to speakers using powerless speech than those using powerful speech. Hypothesis 2 was strongly supported, but neither speaker gender nor participant age had a significant effect on ratings. The prediction that female speakers using powerless rather than powerful speech would receive higher ratings received some indirect support; female speakers using a powerless style received higher ratings than male speakers. Results suggest that the features of powerless speech have a significant effect on how joke tellers are perceived."

Neither of these polarizing narratives adequately describes the relationship of people and society to technology. In this thesis, I will use sociological analysis to push beyond clichéd cultural ideas about technology to critically examine quantified self wearable technology. Through wearable technology and quantified self practices, users reenchant their lives through the spectacular wonder of consumerism and the modern moral narratives of science and technology. However, the true relationship to analyze is not that between user and their technology, but user and the expert systems that create the technology. This relationship is characterized by the choice structures that contour a user's behavior, constituting a method of control that produces a normative bodily style that users seek to attain through proper and morally-charged practices of self control. As expert systems form a transcendent authority, users gain meaning but lose power, and the increasing alienation they feel manifests itself in mistrust and ambivalence about the expert systems. Discursive negotiations that stem from this dual experience of mistrust and meaning, from concern over the changing nature of humanity to debates about personal privacy, create tension over the view of technology, which oscillates between utopia to dystopia. Ultimately, I seek to use this technology as a starting point to investigate meaning, control, freedom, and self in late modernity."

Political Science",2015,"Paarlberg, Robert L.
Joseph, William A.","The chilly diplomatic relationship between the PRC and the United States from 1949 to 1969 is often taken for granted and regarded as natural. However, an analysis of the strategic positions of the two states suggests that there were several points in the 1960s at which the PRC and the United States might have been expected to reconcile with each other as they faced a greater threat-the USSR. Traditional ""balance against threat"" theories suggest that states tend to join together to balance against the most dangerous common foe. However, in the case of Sino-U.S. Cold War relations, both the PRC and the United States seemed to have deviated from ""balance against threat"" expectations to a certain extent. This thesis will address the question of why the PRC and the United States did not pursue reconciliation in the 1960s despite the threat posed by the USSR to both. The discrepancies between theory and observation suggest that other factors-such as ideological inclinations and domestic or intra-party politics-were at work in both preventing and causing Sino-U.S. rapprochement. This thesis argues that a series of contingent events affected the geopolitical calculations, domestic political dynamics, and ideological inclinations of the PRC and the U.S. leaderships. Shifts in all three factors made Sino-U.S. rapprochement difficult, if not impossible, before 1969, but a ""perfect storm"" of changes on both the domestic and international scene made Sino-U.S. reconciliation possible."

Individuals with schizophrenia often exhibit abnormalities in behavior, cognition, and sociability. While the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors have been implicated in its onset. This thesis seeks to validate the GCPII+/-/rAAV9 genetic and epigenetic mouse model of schizophrenia by observing whether it induces neurochemical, neurostructural, and behavioral abnormalities that mimic those observed in human patients. Previous studies in our laboratory explored a GCPII+/- mouse model of schizophrenia in which the folate 1 gene, necessary for the production of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), was knocked out. Thus, these mice were hypothesized to model glutamate receptor dysfunction by exhibiting altered levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Past studies using Magnetic Resonance Imaging to acquire coronal images of the brain for volumetric analysis, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to evaluate neurometabolite levels, and a behavioral paradigm to examine social tendencies demonstrated that the GCPII+/- model exhibited some, but not all, of the abnormalities associated with schizophrenia in humans. In order to induce epigenetic dysregulation and modify the previous model, a recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (rAAV9) carrying histone deacetylase enzyme 1 cDNA was introduced into postnatal day (PND) 1 GCPII+/- mice. To further characterize this modified model, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was used to visualize abnormalities in white matter connectivity in the brain. This thesis offers an initial analysis of the updated genetic and epigenetic mouse model of schizophrenia as well as an overview of the potential for DTI to be used in future studies."

McKnight, Robin","Does free and fair trade benefit the workers in an industry? My thesis investigates this question in the context of the Multifiber Arrangement, a system of quotas established in 1974 to protect the textile industries in developed countries by restricting cheaper imports from developing countries. Lifting of these quotas mandated by the WTO between 1995 and 2005, therefore, meant opportunities for greater textile production in internationally competitive developing economies such as India, where the textile industry accounts for over 5.2% of global production and is the second largest generator of employment after agriculture. In labor-intensive industries, an increase in production should further mean more employment, and possibly higher wages and improved livelihood. Using variation in the pre-agreement industry mix across states in India, my results suggest that textile and clothing production and employment grew as the MFA quotas were lifted, and that larger textile-producing states pre-reform saw a greater increase in output and employment than smaller producers. I also find that larger producers of textiles experienced a greater decline in absolute poverty, but a differential rise in inequality; benefits to the quota removal seem to be going to the owners of big textiles businesses, and not workers."

173,The Growth in the VA's Disability Compensation Program: The Role of Health,"Dougherty, Isabella J.",Economics,2015,"Coile, Courtney C.
Kerr, Sari A.","The VA's Disability Compensation (VADC) program, which provides monthly tax-free cash benefits for qualifying disabled veterans, has been growing rapidly since 2001. The drivers of the program's growth are not well understood and worsening health is one possible driver, but recent liberalizations of medical eligibility criteria may also play a role. This study decomposes the recent growth in the VADC program into the share of the program's growth due to worsening veteran health and the share due to other factors. I use data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate the relationship between health and receipt of VADC benefits in the late 1990s, and then use those estimates along with the actual health of recent veterans to project the share of today's veterans that would be on the program if eligibility criteria had not changed. My primary empirical finding is that the worsening health of veterans can only explain about one-quarter of the program's growth. This result suggests that the program is not growing primarily due to veterans being in worse health during the post-period. Rather, the program is growing mostly as a result of other factors unrelated to health status. These findings may help policy makers as they consider how to balance the needs of wounded veterans against rapidly rising program expenditures."

Theran, Sally
Carli, Linda","Gender is one of the more complicated identity traits to model, investigate, and comprehend. Despite this complexity, researchers have long found that the establishment of gender identity is fundamental to even a very young child's developing sense of self. As children strive to learn about complex social norms, including those regarding gender, play is one of their best tools for comprehending and exploring social rules and expectations. Through play, children are able to express and process their emotions, and in interaction with their peers, they are also given the opportunity to recreate and explore social dynamics (Kyratzis & Ervin-Tripp, 1999; Russ & Fiorelli, 2010). In fantasy play, the themes children explore are strongly related to their own real-world behaviors and home lives (Von Klitzing, Kelsay, Emde, Robinson, & Schmitz, 2000). In the present study, the relations between children's formation of and adherence to gender stereotypes, their preferences for specific styles of play, their playmates, and the narratives they create during play were explored in a laboratory preschool setting. Results showed both that these preschoolers were well aware of prevailing gender stereotypes, and that these stereotypes were frequently exhibited in their own gendered behavior, as displayed during naturalistic play observations and an experimenter-designed play situation. Data from this 2016 investigation are compared to results reported in previous studies carried out two or more decades ago and similarities and differences across experimental findings are discussed."
175,A Computational Approach to Foreign Accent Classification,"Ahn, Emily",Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,2016,"Reddy, Sravana","As speech recognition and intelligent systems are more prevalent in society today, we need to account for the variety of accents in spoken language. An important step involves identifying the type of accent given a sample of speech. For this thesis, we have coded machine learning algorithms to classify accents from foreign-accented English. Given a data set of 4925 phone calls that span 23 different accents, we have trained Gaussian Mixture Models for each accent with two main methods. The text-independent classifier assumes that we took sound features without knowing the transcriptions of the speech, while the text-dependent classifier relies on transcriptions in order to align each phoneme (or sound unit, e.g. /AH/ and /K/) to its utterance in the data. We acquired these transcriptions by releasing tasks via Amazon Mechanical Turk for the following 7 accents: Arabic, Czech, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, and Mandarin. Upon evaluation, we found that a 7-way accent identification task achieved an accuracy rate of 41.38% for the text-independent classifier and 45.12% for the text-dependent classifier."

Mathematics",2015,"Keane, Margaret M.","Memory performance is often better for events or items that are retrieved in a context similar to the context in which they were experienced. The presence or absence of such context effects can be explained by the outshining hypothesis (Smith & Vela, 2001), which states that, at retrieval, there are two types of cues that memory depends on, the context cue and the item cue. The stronger of these two cues suppresses, or ""outshines"" the weaker cue thus strengthening or eliminating context effects. Context effects are eliminated when memory performance is driven by the stronger item cue, which then 'outshines' the weaker context cue. In the present study, I examine the outshining hypothesis by manipulating the strengths of the context and item cues using concrete words (stronger item cue) and abstract words (weaker item cue) studied in two different kinds of context, videos (stronger context cue) and background color (weaker context cue). Contrary to the predictions of the outshining hypothesis, the context effect for abstract words was no greater than for concrete words. The study also failed to find greater context effects for video than background color context effects.

Jumping in and out of abstraction through catalogues that capture New York City as gritty and gilded, O'Hara diverts attention away from the heightened emotional state of the narrator. He additionally channels the fragmentary nature of Abstract Expressionism, jump cuts, and improvisational jazz. By the time of his death at the ripe age of forty, O'Hara produced a body of work as multifaceted as his artistic interests."

The Occupation (1940-44) was marked not only by the daily stress of living alongside the German enemy, but also by a civil war within the French population. Existing critical works on Irène Némirovsky, a Russian-Jewish author writing in France during the Occupation, focus on fitting Némirovsky's wartime writing into a certain political and ideological framework; however, these attempts to label Némirovsky's political stance are far too reductive. In my thesis, I have taken the opposite approach, seeking to bring to light the complexity of Némirovsky's ambivalent representation of Germans, as well as of French elites and women. Rather than producing unequivocal propaganda works, Némirovsky portrays these external and internal enemies to French national solidarity in order to consider timeless ethical questions regarding individual responsibility and collective identity."

188,Constructing an Autocorrelation System to Identify Single Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond,"Paik, Eunice",Physics,2015,"Berg, Robert","The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a defect in the structure of diamond, roughly the size of a single atom, that possesses properties that make it applicable to quantum information processing, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and probing biological systems. When an NV center is excited by green light of wavelength 523 nm, it emits red light of in the range from 600-800 nm tens of nanoseconds later. A confocal microscope can be used to excite and collect emitted photons from NV centers. By detecting the intensity of the emitted red photons, we can determine the quantum state of a single NV center, which is needed to build various quantum computing, sensing and imaging devices. The autocorrelation method is used to detect antibunching in the emission of red photons and ascertain that the observed photons are being emitted from a single NV center. We have built an autocorrelation device that measures, with sub-nanosecond accuracy, the statistical distribution of the arrival times of the red photons emitted from a diamond sample at a photon counter. The device can measure fixed time values with a time resolution of 120 ps FWHM. For uncorrelated sources measured for 120 seconds at the TAC full range of 100 ns, the average counts in each histogram bin were about 0.01% of the predicted value. The autocorrelation device that we have built costs about 10 times less than commercial units used by other NV researchers."

Building from Bourdieu's theories on capital and field, this study highlights how students from non-dominant backgrounds have to adapt and overcome to succeed in an admissions system designed to reward the cultural capital available to students from educated families. I conducted 18 in depth, semi structured interviews with high school students and recent graduates to uncover the motivations and behaviors in their college choice process. Information in their immediate networks and affiliation with college-access programs were able to ""intervene"" and introduce students to the preparation behaviors necessary for elite college admission. Students with college access program (CAP) affiliations were able to prepare for college admissions in a collaborative way, with the help of newfound social connections facilitated by their CAPs. Students without program assistance were less likely to reach to their networks and engaged with the college application process in a more independent manner."
192,Faith and Feminicide: The Catholic Church's Efforts to Combat Feminicide in Guatemala,"Ruden, Majaella",Peace and Justice Studies,2019,"Hajj, Nadya","In contemporary Guatemala, women frequently fall victim to the crime of feminicide, the ""systematic"" ""killing of females by males because they are females (Tierney FitzGerald 2016, 2; Russell 2001, 13)."" By drawing on scholarship from multiple academic disciplines including Women's and Gender Studies, Theological Studies, Peace and Justice Studies and Political Science, this study aims to expand its readers' understanding of feminicide and increase their ability to help address this phenomenon. To do so, I answer the central research question: Though it has acted as a protector of the country's most vulnerable communities in the past, is the Catholic Church, in fact, working to reduce rates of feminicide in post-civil war Guatemala? And, if so how? An analysis of the Guatemalan Catholic Church's nine post-war collective pastoral letters, the individual actions of the thirty-one Guatemalan Catholic bishops who signed those letters, and the programs hosted by six Guatemalan Catholic social organizations ultimately reveals this religious institution is neither working to reduce the country's feminicide rate nor acting in ways that cause it to worsen."
193,Evolutionary Development of the Mammalian Pre-Sternum,"Yozgyur, Zeynep",Biological Sciences,2019,,"The mammalian sternum has undergone a reduction in relative size and complexity over evolutionary time. This transformation was highly variable across species, generating multiple, controversial interpretations. Some authors claim that the evolutionary reduction led to loss of presternal elements, while others believe that all, or some, presternal elements were fused into a structure ambiguously referred to as the ""manubrium"", a term adopted from the post-interclavicular unit of pre-mammalian ancestors. Previous work on the Paramylodon harlani presternum revealed a composite presternum and identified three elements - mediocranial, mediocaudal and lateral - each with a different developmental origin and marginal articulation. This project used medical and micro CT scans to determine if these elements are conserved across species and if there is a characteristic histology associated with each. All three elements were identified in humans based on their locations and articulations. Their fusion during ontogeny was documented. Elements could not be associated with a characteristic histology. Instead, histology appears to reflect the mechanical forces to which different regions of the presternum are subjected, whatever their developmental origin. This opens the possibility that the presternum can be used to infer the limb use and locomotor style of extinct taxa. These lines of evidence indicate that the reduction of relative sternal size seen over evolutionary time has not led to element loss. Instead, three conserved elements with unique developmental origins and articulations are present in a composite presternum. Further, this reasoning suggests that the use of the term ""manubrium"" should be abandoned as ambiguous and instead when referring to specific areas on the presternum the terms interclavicle, sternal bands, and lateral elements should be used."

196,Why She Didn't Just Leave: The Effect of Nuisance Ordinances on Domestic Violence,"Moss, Emily",Economics,2019,"Shastry, Gauri Kartini","Municipalities throughout the country have adopted nuisance ordinances to recruit landlords in assisting with crime control. Nuisance ordinances are municipality-level policies that sanction landlords if police are frequently called to respond to a landlord's tenants. To avoid a fine, landlords must abate tenants whose conduct was considered a nuisance under the municipality's ordinance; most often, this abatement process involves evicting the tenant. Little research has evaluated the impact of nuisance ordinances on innocent tenants - particularly, female victims of domestic violence. Because domestic violence is seldom excluded from the list of nuisance activities considered under the ordinances, legal advocates have warned that the threat of eviction associated with nuisance ordinances could discourage domestic violence victims from reporting their abuse to the police. This thesis contributes the first econometric analysis of the effect of nuisance ordinances on domestic violence reporting and incidence. The variation in nuisance ordinance enactment across municipalities and over time provides the framework to identify the causal effect of nuisance ordinances on domestic violence using a difference-in-differences strategy. I find that nuisance ordinance enactment leads to a 16.5-23.2 percent reduction in domestic violence-related 911 calls for assistance and a 0.4-0.7 percentage point increase in self-reported domestic violence incidence in California. Nationwide, I also find nuisance ordinance enactment is associated with a statistically significant increase in online search activity related to domestic violence as a proxy for domestic violence incidence. These results suggest that nuisance ordinances have the unintended consequence of discouraging domestic violence victims from reporting their abuse, thereby allowing the incidence of domestic violence to persist."
197,Towards understanding the variability between rates of biological productivity in the Beaufort Gyre of the Arctic Ocean,"Ji, Brenda Y",Biological Sciences,2018,,"Oceans account for more than 25% of anthropogenic CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Changes in our global climate have affected the Arctic Ocean in particular, resulting in increasing rates of warming and record-low sea ice extent, which for example, in the summer of 2012, was only half of the average over the previous three decades. It is unclear how these changes in the Arctic Ocean may affect biological productivity, which is one of the main drivers of the oceanic carbon cycle as CO2is consumed through photosynthesis and released through respiration. In order to investigate how these changes may influence the efficacy of the Arctic Ocean as a carbon sink, we calculated the gross oxygen production (GOP), which is the rate of total photosynthesis, and the net community production (NCP), which is the rate of photosynthesis minus community respiration and thus represents the strength of the carbon sink. The chemical gas tracers, triple oxygen isotopes and O2/Ar ratios, as measured in samples from the surface waters of the Beaufort Gyre region of the Canada Basin, were used to quantify gross oxygen production and net community production, respectively, in late summer and early fall over six years (2011-2016). We examined the effects of location, ice cover, chlorophyll-a, season, and more to better understand the collective impact of these physical conditions on biological productivity rates. Over these six years, mean GOP rates ranged from 9.1 ± 1 mmol O2 m⁻² d⁻¹ to 40 ± 4 mmol O2 m⁻²d⁻¹ and mean NCP rates ranged from 1.1 ± 0.2 mmol O2 m⁻² d⁻¹ to 2.5 ± 0.2 mmol O2 m⁻² d⁻¹. Analyzing inter-annual variations in these rates can enlighten our understanding of how dramatic changes in the global climate may impact the ability of this region in the Arctic Ocean to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."
198,The Influence of Deep Convection on Biologically Driven Carbon Sequestration in the Irminger Sea,"Wanzer, Lucy",Geosciences,2019,,"The North Atlantic plays a key role in sequestering anthropogenic carbon. The biological carbon pump is one of the mechanisms by which carbon is sequestered in the ocean. Phytoplankton photosynthesize at the sea surface, and fix carbon dioxide into organic carbon, a fraction of which sinks to the deep ocean. For sinking carbon to be stored long-term (time scales > 1 year), it must sink deeper than the winter ventilation depth before being respired. This study focuses on how deep winter ventilation (convective mixing to depths > 1000 m) in the Irminger Sea influences the sequestration of carbon via the biological pump. We analyze a four-year continuous time series (September 2014 to June 2018) of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, optical backscatter, and chlorophyll fluorescence depth profiles from 200 to 2,600 meters from the Apex Profiler Mooring at the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Global Irminger Sea Array (60.0°N, 39.5°W). Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen data are used to identify the depth and timing of winter mixing. Using dissolved oxygen as a tracer for respiration of sinking organic matter, optical backscatter as a tracer of particulate organic matter, and chlorophyll as an indicator of surface-derived photosynthetic material, the amount of sinking organic carbon ventilated back to the atmosphere in winter, as well as the carbon that escapes below the winter ventilation depth, is evaluated. We present data collected during a research cruise to the Irminger Sea in June 2018, where we collected discrete samples to calibrate sensors on the OOI Apex Profiler Mooring, and determined variability in the depth of winter mixing across the Irminger basin (59.6° - 64.2° N and 21.9° - 41.4° W) using 20 depth profiles of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen from CTD casts. Evidence of deep winter convection was found throughout the basin, though there is variability in the maximum depth of convection, ranging from 1100 to 1500 meters. Using the 2014-2018 time series of data collected by the profiler mooring, we found strong interannual variability in both winter ventilation depths and respiration rates from the in the Irminger Sea, with winter ventilation depths ranging from 800 to 1,150 meters over the four year time period, and depth-integrated respiration rates within the seasonally-ventilated thermocline ranging from 3.62 to 7.66 mol O2 m⁻². We find the highest respiration rates in the upper thermocline which contribute the majority of the carbon that is released back into the atmosphere during mixing. We also find that winter ventilation depth influences how much carbon is ventilated into the atmosphere during winter mixing. This study shows the importance of year-round observations in order to better understand how deep convection influences carbon sequestration by the biological pump."

""Slut"" is, however, a great label; it labels one's sense of promiscuity and autonomy as an aspect of sexual identity. This label, used extensively in modern sexual politics, is anachronistic, yet describes much of the behavior of the women of late medieval literature. Thus the medieval slut's sexual identity focuses on the proliferation of sex and sexuality that seems shameful within her patriarchal narrative, and yet says something truly powerful about who she is in addition to her sexuality. This study examines the stories of specific medieval sluts in order to destabilize traditional readings of the Decameron and Canterbury Tales in favor of a more accurate display of women's desire. A reading in the style of the medieval slut reinforces the ethical framework with which the sluts are already working in order to demonstrate the power that comes from the reclaimed term ""slut."""

On May 8, 1945, Germany transformed from a sovereign state to an occupied territory. The United States and its Allies were tasked with administering the agreed upon plans for occupation in Germany, predominantly focused on denazification and reconstruction. In the American zone, the Occupying Military Government's plans for denazification and reconstruction affected segments of the population very differently. While low-ranking public officials were banned from public service due to their ties to the Nazi regime, powerful industrialists and governmental leaders were gradually welcomed back into positions of responsibility with the government. How did the US government justify its inconsistent enforcement of the Nazi purge and what enabled them to pursue these policies? I argue that the unsettled narrative landscape of postwar America made such contradictions tenable in a chaotic political climate. Through a cultural study of American popular media from 1939-1950, I identify the three dominant narratives of ""the German"" in the US during this time and show how each of these narratives were used to legitimate different reconstruction policies in US-occupied Germany."
203,Reading Mythology in Ocean Vuong's Night Sky With Exit Wounds through Just Memory,"Tran, Havannah",English,2019,"Lee, Yoon Sun
Gonzalez, Octavio R.","In his debut poetry collection, Night Sky with Exit Wounds, queer Vietnamese-American refugee poet Ocean Vuong claims his work is ""an attempt to navigate history through a rewriting or rather, a recasting, of history into a mythology, much in the tradition of our poetic forebears, like Homer, Dante, Milton."" In this myth-making, closely related to memory and the constitution of empire, I read Vuong's collection through scholar and novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen's ""just memory"", a way of memorialization that seeks to give voice to all people involved in conflict, examines the conditions in which war memory is produced, and explains how memory is in service of creating the identity of a nation. I look at the poems ""Telemachus"", ""In Newport I Watch My Father Lay His Cheek to a Beached Dolphin's Wet Back"", ""My Father Writes From Prison"", and ""To My Father / To My Future Son"" as they constitute the mythology of the father, a figure who creates memories of war that Vuong has no access to. I use this framework in relation to its original intent, as a way of configuring national identity through war memory, but also in understanding a queer mythology Vuong puts forth, one that also questions the American identity as a heteronormative ideal. I turn to the poems ""Of Thee I Sing"", ""Seventh Circle of Earth"", ""Because It's Summer"", ""On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous"", and ""Devotion"" in understanding this queer mythology. What proceeds is a broad understanding of Vuong's poetry, in its attempt to give voice to the voiceless and critique the identity/identities of the United States."

205,An Unbiased Variance Estimator of a K-sample U-statistic with Application to AUC in Binary Classification,"Guo, Alexandria",Mathematics,2019,"Wang, Qing","Many questions in research can be rephrased as binary classification tasks, to find simple yes-or-no answers. For example, does a patient have a tumor? Should this email be classified as spam? For classifiers trained to answer these queries, area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) is a popular metric for assessing the performance of a binary classification method, where a larger AUC score indicates an overall better binary classifier. However, due to sampling variation, the model with the largest AUC score for a given data set is not necessarily the optimal model. Thus, it is important to evaluate the variance of AUC. We first recognize that AUC can be estimated unbiasedly in the form of a two-sample U-statistic. We then propose a new method, an unbiased variance estimator of a general $K$-sample U-statistic, and apply it to evaluate the variance of AUC. We suggest choosing the most parsimonious model whose AUC score is within 1 standard error of the maximum AUC. The developed procedure improves model selection algorithms that weigh complexity and performance. To realize the proposed unbiased variance estimator of AUC, we propose to use a partition resampling scheme that yields high computational efficiency. We conduct simulation studies to investigate the performance of the developed method in comparison to bootstrap and jackknife variance estimators. The simulations suggest that the proposal yields comparable or even better results in terms of bias and mean squared error. In addition, it has significantly improved computational efficiency compared to its resampling-based counterparts. Moreover, we also discuss the generalization of the devised method to estimating the variance of a general $K$-sample U-statistic (K >= 2), which has broad applications in practice."

Logvinenko, Igor","When walking in Jerusalem one cannot help but notice the presence of political and religious street art. Slogans, portraits of political and religious figures, ironic political statements, and religious symbols are spray painted, hung, or plastered in public view. At first glance the city seems to be peppered with political expression originating from authentic roots of civil society- the artisan social commentators. However, upon reflection, one comes to notice that much of the paint is chipped, and the political commentary is no longer relevant to contemporary issues. It is puzzling that a population having just achieved renewed dominant status in a military operation (Operation Protective Edge, 2014), simultaneously experiences a decline in private political-cultural participation, specifically through street art. This study measures the fluctuations in street art in Jerusalem going back, before summer 2014 to capture the decline in street art during military operations. This study finds that decline in creative class public expression is linked primarily to intervening institutions working to stimulate culture in Jerusalem. We attribute part of this observed cultural lull to such institutions stopping to stimulate culture, specifically, during military operations."

Lindner, John","In 2017 an interstellar visitor, 'Oumuamua, was discovered by Robert Weryk at Haleakala Observatory, Hawai'i. Analysis of 'Oumuamua's light curve suggests it has a highly elongated shape. The dynamics of such irregularly shaped objects cannot be modeled with simple approximations; while Newton's sphere theorem allows us to model the gravitational dynamics of spherically symmetric objects as point masses, a spherical approximation is insufficient to describe the interactions of highly elliptical objects like 'Oumuamua -- and even Earth, which is not a true sphere but rather an oblate spheroid. Fortunately, there exist closed-form expressions for the gravitational potential of a spheroid. For this project, I use Mathematica to solve systems of nonlinear differential equations to model the motion of an object sliding on such a spheroid. Under certain conditions, the path of the slider becomes highly sensitive to initial conditions. This sensitivity manifests as chaos, which is apparent both qualitatively and quantitatively."
208,"Troubled Waters: China's and Russia's Naval Modernizations Programs, and the Causes of Offensive Naval Arms Race","Qin, Heng",Political Science,2018,"Goddard, Stacie
MacDonald, Paul K.","Scholars, policymakers and the public alike have debated the revisionist or status quo intentions of China and Russia using metrics such as territorial and economic expansionism. However, few have tried to explain why the two states' arms policies may or may not signal intentions. This thesis project makes the point that structural factors, not intentions, drive offensive arms races. Using open-source databases and congressional hearing transcripts, I focus on Russia's and China's maritime push outwards through naval technological investments, as well as the structural factors, including offense-defense balance and near-peer competition, that surround these buildups. By showcasing the inherent military and strategic values of the contested maritime space, I argue that technological and geographical factors favor conquest and strategic offensives in territorial competition. This offense dominance compels states to pursue offensive naval buildups, regardless of intentions. Therefore, in an effort to avoid the rational offensive arms race, state leaders should seek to alter the offense-dominant environment at play, as opposed to feeding into the downward spiral that is otherwise known as security dilemma."
209,Planet Candidate Validation in K2 Crowded Fields,"Rampalli, Rayna",Astrophysics,2018,,"The discovery of planets outside of our own solar system has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike. In just the past decade, more than 3000 planets have been discovered with the groundbreaking NASA telescope missions Kepler and its successor, K2. In just three years, the K2 mission has yielded some remarkable results, with the discovery of over 300 confirmed planets and 480 reported planet candidates to be validated. The K2 mission detects planets by recording any periodic dimming in stars; this dimming often indicates that a planet is in orbit around the star, blocking a portion of its light. A major challenge with the analysis of these data is to identify planets in star-crowded regions, where individual camera pixels overlap multiple stars. In this thesis, I developed, tested, and evaluated a validation process for ruling out false-positive detections of planets in K2 observations of star-crowded regions. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, I fitted a model to obtain the transit parameters for each candidate planetary system. Later, I used seeing-limited on/off imaging to rule out false positives due to nearby transiting binary star systems. These results were then evaluated using a software program called validation of exoplanet signals using a probabilistic algorithm (VESPA) to estimate the probability of a false-positive detection. Such techniques and results are important tools for conducting candidate validation and follow-up observations for space-based missions, including the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, since its large camera pixels resemble K2 star-crowded fields."

This thesis considers the nature of sin and its function in society, as depicted in Leviticus 16, by means of comparing several different theological and anthropological models regarding sin and impurity, in combination with a close reading of the Hebrew. The image of sin and impurity that emerges includes a dual system of ritual and moral impurity, which in part could well be used to establish a social structure and hierarchy, and is in Leviticus 16 put in service of promoting the role of the High Priest as the mediator between God and the Israelites, and the only one capable of maintaining and fixing that relationship in the face of sin and impurity."
212,Suggested Blocks: Using Neural Networks To Aid Novice Programmers In App Inventor,"Svanberg, Maja Susanna",Computer Science,2018,"Turbak, Franklyn","MIT App Inventor is a programming environment in which users build Android applications by connecting blocks together. Because its main audience is beginner programmers, it is important that users are given the proper guidance and instruction to successfully become creators. In order to offer this help, App Inventor provides text-based tutorials that describe the workflow of example programs to users. However, studies have shown that out-of-context help such as tutorials has little to no effect on learning, and when given the choice, users prefer in-context hints and suggestions. In order for users to overcome some of the barriers with self-training, we need to provide them with relevant information and in-context suggestions. Therefore, I am introducing Suggested Blocks, a data-driven model that leverages machine learning to provide users with relevant suggestions of which blocks to include in their programs. In this project, I focused on developing the neural networks to power a suggested blocks system. Using original apps from real App Inventor users, I developed a set of experiments to discover plausible vector representations of the data, including tree traversals, n-grams, tree structures, as well as different network architectures to generate the best possible block suggestions for the users. The objective is not only to be accurate, but to provide suggestions that are sensible, relevant, and most importantly, educational. When simulating the best model on reconstructing an original project from a novice user, suggesting only 10 blocks at a time, the user would be able to drag-and-drop 60% of her blocks straight form the Suggested Blocks drawer. Overall, the results show promise for a future implementation of a Suggested Blocks system."
213,The Future of Futurism: From Noise Intoners to Noise Taction,"Tosca, Diana",Music,2018,"Johnson, Jenny
Shaer, Orit","In the early 20th century, Italian Futurists became interested in expanding the definition of music to include sounds previously considered non-musical--sounds often described as 'noise.' The intonarumori (noise intoners) was a family of instruments created by the Futurist artist Luigi Russolo, which allows for the player to control the pitch and sound of the these noises. This thesis gives background on the history of Futurism and its relationship to music, analyzes noise in a Futurist context, and describes the recreation of the intonarumori, dubbed the tattorumori (noise tactions), using new interactive surface technology unavailable to Russolo. The significance of this instrument with regards to both the Futurist movement and music history is that it challenges the established idea of what music is and embodies the ideas of modernity; the intonarumori bridges the gap between sound and music. The reimagining of the instrument explores the vision of Futurism in context the present, using Russolo's instrument as a blueprint with the technology of a century later."

While AO has been commonly used on ground based telescopes, it has many useful benefits in space. AO can be a critical difference in reaching the necessary contrast, of 1010, to image Earth-like exoplanets. It allows for corrections of optical imperfections and thermal distortions. These correction capabilities also allow launches of cheaper optics, and have further implications for use with inter-satellite laser communication and high energy applications. DeMi will use a closed-loop adaptive optics system, that incorporates a Shack- Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS), DM, and CMOS cameras, in multiple mission operations to demonstrate the capabilities of this adaptive optics technique. DeMi will launch in to a low-Earth orbit in mid 2019. During its lifetime, DeMi will complete both internal and external observations. The internal observations will use a laser to characterize the DM and test the wavefront correction. The external observations will demonstrate the wavefront correction on stars."

This study sought to identify and test natural products for anti-borrelial qualities, using anecdotal success as an initial filter. Thirty-five herbal Lyme disease treatments were so identified. Extracts from these materials were made using three solvents, and tested against Borrelia burgdorferi. Anecdotal success proved to be an effective filter for Borrelia inhibition, allowing us to identify several extracts which inhibited its growth, and also several growth enhancers, each of which should be further investigated as relevant to understanding and treating Borrelia infections in humans."

This is accomplished in all three poems through the conjuring up of a physical region, which establishes an awareness of spatial relations between the poet and the space in which he dwells. I explore how the poems' speakers position themselves and other entities relative to these outside features in ways that enable a more vivid expression of the nonexistence of distinct divisions. Through the exploration of ambiguous boundaries in the relationships that the speaker holds with the external world, we consider the reach of poetry beyond the physical and temporal limitations of the poem's space and towards new worlds."

Computer Science",2019,,"Lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dot (QD) solar cells are emerging thin film solar cells that are solution processible at low temperatures, potentially on lightweight and flexible substrates at a low cost. Despite this prospect, PbS QD solar cells remain far from commercialization due to their low power conversion efficiency compared to other types of solar cell. This thesis explores the development of a novel surface passivation protocol to raise the open circuit voltage of PbS QD solar cells and thereby improve the power conversion efficiency. The protocol implements a novel solution phase ligand exchange method that involves two kinds of halide salts. The impacts of these salts on PbS QD solar cell performance and optical properties are studied through a comparison of a control process---that involves only one kind of halide salt---to the proposed process---that utilizes dual halide treatment. Particularly, open circuit voltage is both experimentally measured and theoretically calculated to assess the potential of the proposed treatment. In both cases, devices made with the novel dual halide treatment show improved open circuit voltage compared to the devices made with the control process. This improvement presents the potential for multiple halide treatment in better surface passivation. Moreover, theoretical results being in good agreement with the observed results suggests the viability of theoretical performance analysis using optical measurements in surface passivation studies."
224,Investigating Genomic Regulatory Elements in Adipocytes via Computational Analysis,"Bejar, Andrea",Biological Sciences,2019,"Beers, Melissa
Tsai, Linus","Obesity prevalence has more than doubled since the 1980s. One possible consequence of obesity is insulin resistance (IR), a condition underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). So far, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have attributed 18% of heritable risk for T2DM to genetic variants, but one shortcoming of GWAS is knowing which genes are affected by identified variants. This study aimed to confront this weakness and investigate how epigenetic regulation affects metabolic phenotype. Three histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3) were targeted by chromatin immunoprecipitation for in vivo samples collected from human subcutaneous adipocytes and metabolically-relevant tissue samples curated from the ENCODE database. We developed the Extremity analysis method to identify enhancers and promoters enriched in histone ChIP-Seq data. Additionally, a full suite of well-established bioinformatics methods were employed, including differential enrichment analysis (DEA) and motif enrichment analysis (MEA), and existing obesity related GWAS were incorporated. Close correlation was found between Extremity and DEA, MEA provided enriched motifs that bind known adipogenic TFs, and the GWAS showed variants in T2DM and WHRadjBMI overlapping H3K4me3 have less heritability in adipocytes than the other two marks. This study provides a new method and potential targets for further understanding epigenetic variation and its effect on metabolic phenotype."

226,Acylated Sulfa Drugs: A Phthesis on the Synthesis of Acylated Sulfa Compounds in Connection with Antitubercular Drug Design,"Pugh, Catherine",Chemistry,2019,"Hearn, Michael J.","Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Improved sanitation and successful chemotherapy have largely eliminated TB in industrialized countries, but it remains a serious threat to lower socio-economic classes, the immunocompromised population, and developing countries where industrialization is just taking hold. Although two new drugs have surfaced in the last decade, they are largely reserved for compassionate cases because of the severity of their side effects. The first-line TB treatment prescribed by the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention remains the comparatively small number of drugs synthesized or isolated in the 1950's and 1960's. These drugs, while currently effective, can cause adverse side effects such as liver toxicity. Additionally, the emergence of strains of drug-resistant TB threatens to completely undermine existing treatment regimens and enable TB to reach a level of prevalence not experienced for the past century. In the past decade, studies have suggested intriguing antitubercular possibilities offered by applying modern methods to a very early class of drugs: the sulfa drugs. Sulfa drugs work by mimicking the natural molecule para-aminobenzoic acid, inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and resulting in cell death. Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) de-activate sulfa drugs inside the body by catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group onto position N⁴ of the sulfa molecule. NATs also appear in M. tuberculosis, where they act as a defense mechanism for MTB against chemotherapy. My work in the Hearn lab has been guided by recent crystallographic images of the DHPS binding pocket and the deactivating mechanism of NATs, as well as by previous studies in our lab that demonstrated that acylation can improve activity and bioavailability while reducing toxicity. Our work began with the development of a reliable protocol to prepare the acetylated NAT metabolites. We then explored a number of different procedures for increasing acyl chain length at N⁴, focusing on derivatives of sulfamethazine; and then continued to selective di-acylation at both N⁴ and N¹, varying both chain length and steric bulk for a number of different sulfa drug scaffolds. Several of our acylated sulfa derivatives possess improved biological and anti-tubercular properties over their parent drugs. Moreover, the compounds serve as probes of the structural factors influencing biological activity such as fit within DHPS, resistance to the de-activating effects of NATs, and permeability."
227,Formation of O2 From CO2 Ice Photolysis,"Buffo, Christina",Chemical Physics,2019,"Arumainayagam, Chris
Öberg, Karin","The recent Rosetta and Giotto missions to comets have detected the presence of a surprisingly large amount of O2 within cometary comae. Most comet formation models suggest that comet compositions preserve conditions in the early solar system, so one possible origin of this diatomic oxygen is formation within ice layers on small dust particles in space before or during solar system formation. One common ice component is carbon dioxide, and this thesis focuses on O2 formation from UV photolysis of CO2 ices. Viewed in the context of the evolution of related molecules, CO and O3, we examine O2 production as a function of UV photon fluence and ice temperature. We report that the ideal conditions for O2 production are a large photon fluence and ice temperatures in the range of 20-25 K, which are reasonable conditions for the interstellar medium. In light of these findings, we propose that interstellar regions with significant CO2 ice could partially explain the large abundance of O2 in comets."

DeSombre, Beth
Matthes, Jackie Hatala","The ultimate purpose of this thesis is to contribute to evidence on good practices for countries to employ in support of food security under the conditions of climate change. Food security, as defined by the World Food Summit of 1996, is ""when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life."" It is usually broken down into four pillars: availability, accessibility, usage, and stability, creating a comprehensive foundation of the elements required for people to be properly nourished. This four-pillar approach is central to the framework of this thesis, as it allows us to understand the different factors contributing to food security, and thus to analyze current policy for how well these policies may address the states' problem areas under the conditions of climate change. In order to accomplish this overarching goal, this thesis seeks to answer the following three questions: 1.In what ways does a rights-based approach to food security help prepare countries for the fight against hunger under the conditions of climate change? 2. How do current agricultural and climate change policies contribute to food security? and 3. What should these countries do to improve food security domestically both now and in the future? Answering these questions will be accomplished by through the study of four countries, Bolivia, Kenya, Nepal, and Ukraine. Agriculture lies at the heart of food security, contributing to each of the pillars for overall improved food security. Although agriculture is most commonly linked with availability, or the supply of food, it also contributes to access, or the economic and physical ability of people to procure food. The linkages between agricultural development and poverty alleviation are complex, but it is generally accepted that agricultural development significantly contributes to lifting people from poverty. In addition, changes in precipitation and temperature with climate change may impact agricultural production. To answer the second question, I depend heavily on historical, political, and geographical analysis to understand the country context and to create the elements by which I assess the policy. I find that while every country studied is taking some action to mitigate or adapt to climate change and support food security through agricultural policy, there is no one-size-fits-all model. Results of the agricultural and climate change policies analysis supports the context-specific approach to formulating and evaluating policy. In 1967, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) created the legal framework on an international level to assure that everyone gets fed using the individual rights approach. Enshrining the right to food in international law, however, is not enough to ensure the end of world hunger. States that are party to ICESCR have to take action to respect, protect, and fulfil the right. In order to make the right justiciable in domestic courts so that individuals can bring suit when they feel their right to adequate food has been violated, states often integrate the right to food into their domestic legal systems. Each of the case study countries' constitutions include a provision on the right to food. I find that the context in which the constitution was negotiated has a large impact on the constitutional provision, but that this does not translate into different approaches to food security at the level of agricultural or climate change policy. Based on jurisprudence from Kenya and Nepal, I posit that the right to food is more amenable to the courts when the case involves acute hunger and when there is clear evidence that the government has not done anything to prevent it. Furthermore, in preliminary results, I show that there are significant barriers to accessing justice for the right to food, including through the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which has the potential to allow individuals who feel their rights have been violated to seek help on the international level. Finally, I offer some guidelines for ways to think about creating and assessing agricultural policy. If land rights are a flash point, there needs to be policy put into place that reflects understanding of historical inequalities. Policymakers, whether they be locally-based or foreign consultants should be sensitive to the issue characteristics of any given problem, and try to understand its origin before putting policy into place. Taking into account who farms what, where, and how will help policies be responsive to farmers' needs as well as to climate change. Determining who is vulnerable to food insecurity, and whether they face seasonal, chronic, or acute hunger will allow for better targeting of these groups. Social safety nets and food and nutrition policies that improve access should be included alongside efforts to increase productivity. To minimize the effects of climate change on food security, early warning systems on natural disasters, agricultural research and extension services, as well as agricultural insurance can support both farmers and consumers."
231,Power & the City: an Embodied Approach to Analysis,"Unni, Sabina",Anthropology,2019,"Minor, Elizabeth","States use various mechanisms to legitimize and control behavior. My thesis examines how ancient states regulated power through deliberate city planning by focusing on the postclassic Aztec settlement of Tenochtitlan between 1200 and 1519 CE. More specifically, I discuss (1) sociospatial seclusion, (2) markets, and (3) public monuments. My analytic approach to this thesis is interdisciplinary, bridging the gap between archaeology and anthropology through conventional primary and secondary sources (such as codices, excavation reports, maps, theoretical analysis) as well as experimental sensory approaches. If the city is teeming with affect, why not consider how that came to be? Engagement with the senses as a mode of spatial analysis is thus an exciting technique."

Soares-Santos, Marcelle","In 2017, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration made history by detecting the ripples in space and time-gravitational waves (GW)-emitted by the merger of two neutron stars. Twelve hours later, telescopes detected the bright light produced by the merger-a kilonova. This joint detection marked the beginning of a new era in cosmology. Kilonova GW detections can provide the next generation of cosmological distance measurements, and when combined with redshift from an optical detection, these systems can be used to study the origin and evolution of the universe. Over the next 10 years, we expect LIGO/Virgo detectors to accumulate several times the current number of GW detections. Therefore, accurately measuring the distance is essential to maximize science gains. One problem is that the distance measurement from the GW waveform is degenerate with the inclination angle of the system. In this study, we explore the possibility of measuring the viewing angle solely from the optical signal by building an angle-dependent model of kilonova emission. We generate mock observations and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to study the model's ability to recover the parameters of the data. The results of this thesis indicate that the model can be used to recover the viewing angle parameter."

240,The Effect of the Affordable Care Act on Racial Disparities in Health Access and Outcomes,"Varma, Tanvee",Economics,2018,"Park, Kyung H.","The United States healthcare system is unlike any other in the developed world. The United States pays more for healthcare, has poorer health outcomes, and the highest uninsured rate of the developed world as well as rampant health inequities across race, gender, and class. In an attempt to remedy several of these issues and provide health insurance to low-income Americans, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010. As a part of the ACA, Medicaid was expanded to cover individuals living below 138% of the federal poverty line. Given that the Supreme Court determined that states should have the choice to expand Medicaid, only 25 states expanded Medicaid by January 2014. Using comprehensive health data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, this study explores whether the ACA, and particularly, the expansion of Medicaid, reduced racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance, access, utilization, and outcomes. By employing a difference-in-difference strategy, we find that racial disparities in health insurance coverage, financial risk from healthcare costs, and self-reported general health and mental health decrease. However, there are ambiguous effects on health utilization and physical health outcomes. These improvements are not uniform across race: blacks experience far greater improvements than Hispanics, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Additionally, there are no remarkable differences in racial and ethnic disparities in health between expansion and non-expansion states and individuals living below and above 138% of the federal poverty line after the full implementation of the ACA."

Cantine, Marjorie D.","The Bråvika Member in Northeastern Svalbard is a Cryogenian-aged (630 to 720 Ma), northward-thickening and coarsening-upward wedge of sandstones and dolomites that sits at the boundary between two vastly different climate states: the overlying Wilsonbreen Formation, representing the Marinoan Snowball Earth glaciation, and the underlying Elbobreen Formation, representing a nonglacial interval between the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Large-scale sedimentological and isotopic studies of the Bråvika Member and the surrounding stratigraphy have resulted in three endmember hypotheses for the facies that the Bråvika represents: 1) a fluvial proglacial (sandur) facies related to the Wilsonbreen Formation (Halverson et al., 2004); 2) a glacial or nonglacial aeolian facies (Halverson, 2011); and 3) a nonglacial fluvial facies related to the Elbobreen Formation (Hoffman et al., 2012). This study uses a combination of petrography, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) microtextural analysis, and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis to characterize and assess the facies represented in the mid-lower Bråvika Member in Buldrevågen, Svalbard at a microtextural scale, and is the first study to do so. This study is also the first microtextural study to consider the viability of SelFrag electric pulse disaggregation (EPD) as a method to prepare consolidated samples for microtextural analysis. Two samples of the mid-lower Bråvika Member from Buldrevågen and one modern periglacial aeolian sample from Lake Vanda, Antarctica were compared with 16 other samples from the literature using NMDS. The 16 literature samples represented five different facies: fluvial, glaciofluvial, nonglacial aeolian, periglacial aeolian, and till. The NMDS ordination showed that the two samples from the mid-lower Bråvika Member closely plotted with samples from periglacial aeolian facies. This evidence, taken in conjunction with new and existing field evidence for syndepositional ice (ice-cemented sandstone clasts, a clast of the Wilsonbreen diamictite in the Bråvika) and aeolian transport (large-scale cross-stratification, grain frosting), respectively, is consistent with the interpretation that the mid-lower Bråvika Member in Buldrevågen represents a periglacial aeolian facies, implying that this facies is more closely related to the Marinoan Wilsonbreen Formation."

This group consciousness drives Indian-Americans to identify as Democrats. First, I present several theories of party identification and evaluate their explanatory power, both theoretically and when applied to other groups, such as Jewish Americans and Asian-Americans. I then present an original theory of party identification in the Indian-American community. Next, I explore the nature of newspaper coverage on Indian-Americans by conducting a content analysis of New York Times and India Abroad articles. Finally, I use data from the 2016 CMPS to empirically test my theory. All together, this project provides a new way of considering a well-studied concept applied to an understudied group."
246,Quantifying Air-Sea Gas Exchange at High Wind Speeds Using Noble Gas Measurements: Insights from the SUSTAIN Wind-Wave Tank,"Kinjo, Lumi",Chemistry,2019,,"Gas exchange at high wind speed is not well understood-few studies have been conducted at wind speeds above 15 m s-1, and significant disagreement exists between gas exchange models at high wind speeds. In particular, the flux due to bubbles is not explicitly included in many gas exchange models, despite the fact that bubble-mediated gas exchange becomes increasingly important at higher wind speeds. The goal of my thesis project is to quantify air-sea gas exchange under high wind speeds and to examine the relationship between noble gas measurements, bubble spectra, wave-type, and water temperature. Noble gases serve as excellent tracers for this purpose, as they are biologically and chemically inert, and have a wide range of solubility and diffusivity that responds differently to physical forcing. Over the course of five days, we conducted 35 experiments at the SUrge STructure Atmospheric InteractioN (SUSTAIN) wind-wave tank with wind speeds at 20 - 50 m s-1, water temperatures at 20°C, 26°C, and 32°C, and wave conditions including uniform (regularly breaking) waves and JONSWAP (random, real ocean-like) waves. Continuous Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe ratio measurements were obtained by a Gas Equilibration Mass Spectrometer (GEMS). Additionally, discrete noble gas measurements were collected at the beginning of select experiments and at the end of all experiments for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. Bubble size and volume spectra were obtained using an underwater shadowgraph imaging device. Other physical measurements such as continuous salinity, water temperature, wind/wave velocities, and atmospheric pressure were also obtained. Our result from the conditions with the highest saturation anomalies suggests that steady state saturation anomalies of gases level off as wind speed increases. Additionally, both the temperature dependence of noble gas saturation anomalies and the coherence between bubble surface area spectra and saturation anomalies suggest that partially dissolving bubbles may have an important flux contribution at higher wind speeds. Since the SUSTAIN wind-wave tank is much shallower than the real ocean, we cannot directly apply our results to the ocean to make predictions. Nonetheless, the relationship between gas flux and bubble size spectra, wind, and wave conditions learned from this work provide us with important insights to improve gas exchange models."

Lastly, I create my own visual interpretation of the myth of Medea."
249,Investigating the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit exchange in visual recognition memory,"Li, Ying",Biological Chemistry,2019,,"Visual memory is a complex neurophysiological process wherein visual inputs are transduced and encoded within networks of synapsing neurons. At the core of this system are neurotransmitters and postsynaptic receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are necessary for visual memory in mice. Interestingly, with age there is a predictable, visual experience-dependent replacement of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B by a second subunit, NR2A. Both subunits have been implicated in regulating potentiation in the murine primary visual cortex (V1) in response to visual stimulus in other forms of plasticity, such as ocular dominance. The goal of this project was to characterize NMDA receptor subunit composition changes during the acquisition of visual memory and to elucidate the role of NR2B in stimulus-specific response potentiation (SRP) and orientation-selective habituation (OSH), which are electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations of visual memory, respectively. To this end, we measured NR2A and NR2B protein levels via Western blot in mice before and after six days of exposure to a sinusoidal grating stimulus. We also evaluated SRP and OSH in mice in which NR2B was selectively deleted by Cre recombinase or pharmacologically inhibited by either CP-101,606 or Ro 25-6981. Our preliminary findings indicate that NMDA subunit exchange in V1 is minimal during the acquisition of visual memory. We observed that the loss of NR2B does not appear to impact SRP or OSH, suggesting that the subunit does not play a role in visual memory, although these biological effects are obscured by high variance and small sample sizes. Finally, we report that DMSO-used as a pharmacological vehicle-may inhibit the acquisition, but not the consolidation of visual memory. Our work here on characterising NMDA receptor subunit NR2B explores one aspect of the biochemical basis of plasticity in V1 and suggests alternative mechanisms that underlie visual memory that warrant further investigation in order to fully understand learning and memory."

Edelman, Elazer
Wilcox, Elise","Fibrosis is an incurable feature underlying chronic lung and airway diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that causes partial or total occlusion of the airway with fibrous tissue. In addition to causing these diseases, fibrosis also limits the effectiveness of lung transplants as a long-term treatment for end-stage diseases by causing the complication bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). In order to improve our understanding of airway fibrosis, we have developed and characterized an in vitro cell co-culture model composed of airway epithelial cells and blood vessel endothelial cells through which we can induce fibrotic development. This model is more physiologically relevant than previous single cell-type monolayer cultures, as it features interaction between two cell types that are crucial in fibrotic stimulation and development in the airway. We propose a 3D transwell model featuring an air-liquid interface (ALI) as well as a 2D co-culture model with which cell phenotype-specific markers can be visualized with immunofluorescent microscopy. One step during the progression of fibrosis that can be visualized in this model is epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is the shift of epithelial cells to a fibrotic mesenchymal cell-like state. Using the inflammatory cytokine TGF⓵, we are able to induce fibrotic EMT-like phenotypic changes in our 2D cell co-cultures marked by increased intensity in immunostaining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin. We were not able to observe a similar increased intensity for the mesenchymal marker FSP1, nor were we able to observe a reduced intensity for the epithelial marker E-cadherin that have been previously reported to correspond with EMT. Furthermore, we tested treatment of co-cultures with BMP7, an antagonist of EMT, at various points of EMT induction in attempts to reduce fibrotic development. We found that it is only effective in reversing EMT when added after TGF⓵ and can therefore only potentially be used as a post-treatment option. In this study, we (i) develop a co-culture model with increased physiological relevance to the airway, (ii) characterize effects of TGF-⓵ cytokine-induced fibrotic EMT on this model of the airway epithelium, and (iii) characterize the ability of BMP7 to reduce fibrotic EMT when introduced at various time points in the initiation and development of fibrosis."
251,The Effect of Place-Based Policies on Migration,"Menon, Radhika",Economics,2019,"Abeberese, Ama Baafra","Place-based policies have become a common policy tool for reducing geographic economic disparities. These policies may, however, have the unintended consequence of affecting migration, which may in turn, affect the intended effects of the policies. This paper examines the potential for migration to respond to place-based policies. I analyze the effect of a place-based tax policy in India in the 1990s that provided tax exemptions for newly created firms in eligible districts. I hypothesize that this policy could have an unintended effect of increasing migration to districts that were affected by the policy. Using a regression discontinuity design that exploits the policy design, I find that there was indeed an increase in migration both within treated districts and into treated districts. The main reasons for migrating were for a job transfer or to move with the primary earner of the household. I also find that while nominal wages increased in treated districts, and firms there were more likely to hire workers, an individual's probability of being employed did not increase, implying that the policy had a mixed effect on welfare, possibly due to the migration response dampening the effect of the policy. My results, therefore, provide some insight into the unintended consequences of place-based policies and are useful for considering general equilibrium effects when designing place-based policies."

The error theoretic view picks out a specific sense of imagining as that which will justify our modal beliefs. First, I argue that both Gregory and Yablo's accounts are epistemically circular and in need of revision. I proceed to argue that after revision, both accounts provide tenable error theoretic reason to think that the imagination will guide us towards knowledge of possibilities. In the second chapter, I present Peter Kung (2010) and Dominic Gregory's (2019) imagistic accounts. Contra the error theoretic view, the imagistic position holds that there is something about the imagistic medium of certain imaginings that makes them suitable guides to knowledge of possibilities. In the third chapter, I investigate two cases which probe the adequacy of the various accounts I have examined. While each of the accounts provide a successful evaluation of these cases, it turns out that they all rely on the same error theoretic move in order to do so. The error theoretic accounts predictably offer the strongest defense of that move. Since these cases probe how the imagination fares as a modal epistemological tool and the error theoretic accounts offer the strongest evaluations of them, we have reason to think that those accounts are best equipped to guide us towards knowledge of possibilities."

254,Where Does the Money Go? College Endowments and Their Influence on Expenditures towards Financial Aid,"Vu, Phuong Anh",Economics,2019,"Levine, Phillip B.
Hilt, Eric","In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which imposes a tax of 1.4 percent on the investment returns of highly endowed colleges and universities. One motivation for the law was that these colleges have not sufficiently used their extensive resources to reduce the high prices students pay. My thesis examines the relationship between changes in endowment values and colleges' overall spending and spending by category, with a particular focus on financial aid. I take advantage of the exogenous variation in endowment values generated by the 2008 financial crisis to establish a causal relationship. I find that changes in endowment values consistently result in changes in non-financial aid expenditures in the same direction. In the context of the 2008 financial crisis, falling endowments caused colleges to cut overall spending and spending in each category. However, colleges continued to support low-income students by providing financial aid to even more of them. My results imply that the tax is unlikely to be effective, since the income loss it generates is unlikely to prompt colleges to increase endowment spending, or spending on financial aid without an increase in students' financial need."
255,Birthright or Meritocracy?: Deep Stories and Undocumented Student Access to Higher Education,"Lopez, Marina",Sociology,2019,"Rutherford, Markella","In the United States, allowing undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition has been an oddly contentious topic in legal, political, and social realms. It is at once a debate about immigration law, federalism, sentiment towards immigrants, and the direction for the nation. This thesis explores the various laws and policies that each state across the country holds for allowing undocumented students to receive in-state tuition. In addition to this nationwide survey of states, I focus on four state case studies to explore key factors that led states to grant or deny in-state tuition to undocumented people. An important factor is the shared immigration deep stories, or shared emotional outlook, that I set forth. Emotional deep stories conceiving of America as a Birthright or America as a Meritocracy are reflected in state policies toward undocumented students. Other factors that are analyzed include state political culture, economic sectors, and time when these policies changed. My goal is to evaluate the mechanisms and reasons that allow undocumented students to receive in-state tuition."

257,Alterations in Stream Flow Associated with Gypsy Moth Outbreaks: A Remote Sensing Water Balance Approach,"Smith-Tripp, Sarah","Geosciences
Biological Sciences",2019,,"Background/Question/Methods: The quality and quantity of water resources in the Northeastern United States are reliant upon forested watersheds. In this area, water resources are sourced from shallow aquifers and groundwater storage, which are both closely tied to surface ecosystems. Rates of evapotranspiration are specifically determined by environmental conditions and plant traits of a particular ecosystem. The interconnected nature of water resources to surfaces processes in southern New England makes understanding interactions between ecosystem disturbance and hydrology particularly important. The gypsy moth is a forest insect whose larvae consume leaves of broad-leaved trees. Outbreaks of this insect cause regional decrease in leaf area, which is related to rates of evapotranspiration. This study directly compares seasonal stream discharge during the 2015-2017 gypsy moth outbreak and defoliation to periods of non-defoliation. I hypothesized that decreased evapotranspiration associated with reduced leaf area from would increase flow intensity and discharge produced in proportion to defoliation. To test these hypotheses, this research integrated remotely sensed imagery of gypsy moth defoliation severity with data from USGS stream gages and Daymet precipitation data to understand and quantify the impact of the 2015-2018 gypsy moth outbreak on water resources in southern New England. Results/Conclusions: I found the intensity of defoliation varied greatly annually and over the southern New England hydrologic landscape. Additionally, I found that there was a strong association between increased defoliation and an increased proportion of precipitation exiting a watershed as discharge. By definition of the water balance equation, this increased discharge supports changes in evapotranspiration associated with defoliation are measurable at downstream locations. The magnitude of discharge increase was most apparent at normal and low flow conditions. Discharge increase associated with defoliation is a consistent increase in the amount of water measured at the stream gage. In the context of broader literature, the intense defoliation of 2016-2018 raises important questions for the stability of the forest community and spread of gypsy moth. Increased discharge rates similarly alter the sedimentation and nutrient loading in a watershed. This study recommends future work to focus on how discharge, sedimentation, and nutrient flux are altered by a disturbance, particularly in areas newly affected by gypsy moth outbreaks."
258,Politics and the FOMC: Do Political Preferences Influence the Decisions of Central Bankers?,"Cummings, Rachel",Economics,2019,"Sichel, Daniel
Hilt, Eric","This thesis tests empirically whether the political preferences of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, indicated by party affiliation, the partisan direction of donations to political campaigns, and the party of the President affect their voting behavior when setting monetary policy. I use two main empirical strategies in this project. The first is a linear probability model that examines the correlation between a range of background characteristics of FOMC members--including political affiliation, educational attainment, and work background--on the probability of casting a dissent vote against the majority decision of the FOMC at a particular meeting. The second approach controls for the state of the economy and focuses on whether an FOMC member's vote on interest rates at a particular meeting was for an increase, a decrease, or no change. To control for the state of the economy and its effect on FOMC interest rate decisions, I use predictions from Taylor-like rules that translate measures of economic activity and inflation into prescriptions for interest rates. I then use a multinominal logit specification to assess how partisan affiliation (and several other factors) affect voting choices after controlling for the Taylor-Rule prescriptions. To implement both empirical strategies for this analysis, I constructed a unique data set that ranges from 1970 to 2018, where each observation is a person-meeting. My somewhat surprising results indicate that partisanship emerges based on the party of the sitting President rather than through the party affiliation of FOMC members. In particular, during Republican Administrations, FOMC members downweight the signal from economic conditions when considering decreases in interest rates and also are considerably more likely to vote for rate decreases than is the case during Democratic Administrations. Additionally, I find that my bank president variable is no longer significant, which is surprising because the prior literature finds that bank presidents are hawkish."
259,Characterization of Long-term Cold Storage Effects on Platelet Hemostatic Function and GPIbα Glycan Composition,"Thompson, Mayla",Biological Chemistry,2019,,"Platelet transfusion is an important, life saving therapy for treatment of thrombocytopenia and active bleeding related complications. To be clinically effective, transfused platelets must have sufficient ability to mediate hemostatic regulatory function and circulate. Current practices for storing platelet concentrates (PCs) for transfusion therapy are suboptimal. PCs are standardly stored at room temperature (22-24C°) as cold exposure (4-6C°) irreversibly compromises platelets, making them susceptible to rapid clearance from circulation. Room temperature (RT) storage increases risks of bacterial contamination, thus PCs are restricted to a shelf life of 5 days leading to PC shortages and waste. Cold storage of platelets is an increasingly desirable alternative as risks of bacterial contamination are reduced and PC shelf life extended with cold storage. This study re-evaluates the consequences of long-term (5 day) RT and cold storage on platelet functionality to better inform development of current platelet storage standards. Specifically platelet hemostatic function and platelet GPIbα receptor glycan exposure, as it relates to cold-induced platelet clearance, was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis and aggregometry at select time points. The results of this study demonstrate cold storage better preserves platelet hemostatic functionality than RT storage, thus supporting cold storage as a desirable condition to optimize for PC storage. Furthermore results from this study support a recently proposed, novel, long-term storage platelet clearance mechanism and provide insight into the GPIbα receptor glycan exposure dynamics of long-term RT and cold stored platelets."

261,The Challenges of Algorithmically Assigning Fact-checks: A Sociotechnical Examination of Google's Reviewed Claims,"Lurie, Emma",Computer Science,2019,"Mustafaraj, Eni","In the era of misinformation and machine learning, the fact-checking community is eager to develop semi-automated fact-checking techniques that can detect misinformation and present fact-checks alongside problematic content. This thesis explores the technical elements and social context of one ""claim matching"" system, Google's Reviewed Claims. The Reviewed Claims feature was one of the few user-facing interfaces in the complex socio-technical system between fact-checking organizations, news publishers, Google, and online information seekers. This thesis addresses the following research questions: RQ1: How accurate was Google's Reviewed Claims feature? RQ2: Is it possible to create a consensus definition for ""relevant fact-checks"" to enable the development of more successful automated fact-checking systems? RQ3: How do different actors in the fact-checking ecosystem define relevance? I pursue these research questions through a series of methods including qualitative coding, qualitative content analysis, quantitative data analysis, and user studies. To answer RQ1, I qualitatively label the relevance of 118 algorithmically assigned fact-checks and find that 21% of fact-checks are not relevant to their assigned article. To address RQ2, I find that three independent raters using a survey are only able to come to ""fair-moderate agreement"" about whether the algorithmically assigned fact-checks are relevant to the matched articles. A reconciliation process substantially raised their agreement. This indicates that further discussions may create a common understanding of relevance among information seekers. Using raters' open-ended justification responses, I generated 6 categories of justifications for their explanations. To further evaluate if information seekers shared a common definition of relevance, I asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to classify six different algorithmically assigned fact-checks and found that crowd workers were more likely to find the matched content relevant and were unable to agree on the justifications. With regard to RQ3, a sociotechnical analysis finds that the fact-checking ecosystem is fraught with distrust and conflicting incentives between individual actors (news publishers distrust fact-checking organizations and platforms, fact-checking organizations distrust platforms, etc.). Future systems need to be interpretable and transparent about ""relevance"" and the ways in which claim matching is performed because of the distrust between the actors. Fact-checking is dependent on nuance and context, AI is not technically sophisticated enough to account for these variables. As such, human-in-the-loop models seem to be essential to future semi-automated fact-checking approaches. However, my results indicate untrained crowd workers may not be the ideal candidates for modeling complex values in sociotechnical systems."

Watters, Wes","Spatial variations of thickness and grain size of 2004 and prehistoric tsunami sand layers from Aceh province, Indonesia, are analyzed to better characterize sediment transport by tsunamis. Approximately 200 auger and gravity cores were collected along ~ 10 km of coastline over the past 10 years in an area that was severely impacted by the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami. The sediment cores were described sedimentologically, and grain size distributions of selected sand layers were measured using laser diffraction techniques. The spatial distribution of sedimentary characteristics was analyzed using ArcGIS software. Radiocarbon dating and sediment analysis from onshore and offshore areas provide data on the timing and source areas of the different sand layers. The 2004 tsunami deposited sand up to 1.8 km inland with a maximum thickness of 71 cm and a minimum thickness of .80 cm, showing a trend of landward thinning. Cores collected in swales typically contain sand layers thicker than those located on adjacent beach ridges. The deposit is composed of very fine to coarse sand of mostly siliciclastic origin with some plant material. Grain size analysis provides evidence of normal grading and landward fining at several locations. Separated by layers of peat and organic rich mud, older sand layers of very fine to medium sand were also recovered in a number of cores between .65 and 1.8 km from the present day shoreline. These older, buried sand layers that were previously interpreted as paleotsunami deposits exhibit thicknesses of 1-17 cm and likewise show evidence of normal grading. Sediment cores taken closer to a river located on the northernmost section of the research area contain coarser sand layers with immature compositions of siliciclastics and heavy minerals more typical of fluvial deposition. Modeling suggests flow depths between .44 and 3.54 m and flow velocities between .36 and 1.24 m per s."

But Jane's powerful and memorable feminist declaration to Rochester is often at odds with the many avian metaphors Brontë invents for the novel that compare women to birds. I've long been interested in how certain writers transform traditionally feminized or sexualized natural images like birds to craft a feminist poetics of their own. My senior thesis examines avian imagery in Brontë's Jane Eyre and Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) as critiques of the hierarchal structures in Victorian England that oppress and ""cage"" women and their stories. More broadly, my study examines the way that people who are historically oppressed in Britain and America write in a dominant language that was not built with their freedom in mind."

The wars changed the socio-­economic structure in Rome by eliminating the middle or farmer/soldier class of Roman society, affected the distribution of wealth by funneling money to the highest socio­-economic classes, and altered religious and political institutions through extended contact with the East and the acquisition of new land. It is the goal of this thesis to explore how the introduction of new peoples and cultures, a new economic structure, and a new primary mode of religious thought, following the three Punic Wars, affected the life of the individual Roman citizen. These changes altered the subsequent trajectory, growth, and overall character of the empire. Whether or not these changes to the Roman order were positive or negative is for the reader to decide. However, it is certain that the Punic Wars altered the Roman Empire forever. The descriptions of Rome (and Sicily) before and after the wars show the destructive and transformative quality of extreme and long­-lasting warfare. It is important for a modern reader to understand these changes and influences because the new Rome that emerged at the turn of the century served as a foundational block of Western civilization."

Turner, James Morton","The disposal of municipal solid waste is a cause of concern in its potential for pollution and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, pushing municipalities to embrace greener waste management strategies. Within this context, composting has grown in importance in recent years, particularly as an organic waste management strategy. This includes implementing curbside compostable waste collection programs, operating food scrap drop-off sites, and distributing compost bins. Given that municipal composting seems to be the way forward for many municipalities, it is crucial to ensure that such schemes are environmentally just, economically equitable and socially accessible. My thesis examines within the Massachusetts context what kinds of municipal composting programs work, where, why and how, taking into account differing social factors such as income and education. Using a combination of statistical and case study approaches, I offer insights for municipalities looking to adopt sustainable and localized organic waste management strategies."

271,Malevolent Creativity: A Cross-Cultural Study,"Wang, Michelle Zichun",Psychology,2018,"Hennessey, Beth","Creativity is most often perceived to be a highly desirable and exclusively positive attribute, yet both history and a growing body of research remind us that creativity is not always benevolent. When creativity is deliberately used to cause harm, it is known as ""malevolent creativity."" An extreme example of malevolent creativity is the development of the atomic bomb. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the production of malevolently creative products and problem solutions, this study investigated the degree to which demonstrations of benevolent creativity (commonly referred to simply as creativity), creative self-efficacy (a personal judgment of one's own creative ability), and psychological entitlement (feelings that one is more deserving than others) influenced demonstrations of malevolent creativity among college students. Additionally, the potential role played by culture in the manifestation of malevolent creativity was explored by recruiting participants from the US (n₁ = 60) and China (n₂ = 60). In the present study, creative self-efficacy was found to be a significant predictor of malevolent creativity for both US and Chinese participants. However, benevolent creativity only predicted malevolent creativity for US participants, suggesting that malevolent creativity emerged as a more separate construct from benevolent creativity in China than in the US.

273,Toward a “Nation-state of Culture”: Public Art Museums and Japan’s National Identity and Image in the 1980s,"Li, Yanni",East Asian Studies,2020,"Moon, Katharine H.S.","In this work, I examine the case of Japan and how the Japanese state utilized public art museums in the 1980s and early 1990s to shift their national image to that of a ""nation-state of culture"" (bunka kokka). Museums, especially public ones, are politically implicated institutions. Contrary to their appearance of permanence and insulation, museums are reflective of larger political, economic, and social changes in a society. Drawing upon the theories of Carol Duncan, Pierre Bourdieu, and Tony Bennett, this thesis examines art museums as institutions that facilitate identity and image-formation. Essentially, there are two related types of formations at questions here—the first is how nation-states use museums to shape their national identity and international image, and the second is how individuals form their own social and cultural identity through encounters with the museum. This thesis lies at the intersection of politics, sociology, cultural studies, and museum studies. In this work, I offer a way to unpack and understand the socio-cultural phenomenon of the ""museum boom"" in Japan in the last three decades of the twentieth century by placing it in the context of the international political implications of museums and framing it as a continuity of Japans national identity and image construction efforts since the Meiji era."
274,Stochastic Effects in a Small Self-Replicating System,"Anderson, Hope D",Physics,2020,"Hu, Yue","In this thesis, we studied a model self-replicating, oscillatory biochemical system – the Templator – with a focus on how chemical reactions proceed with small numbers of molecules. There is a random, or stochastic, element to exactly when molecules collide with one another and react. In large systems, such as a flask in a laboratory, these elements tend to average out, leaving a deterministic chemical reaction. However, in smaller systems, such as a biological cell, this is not always the case, especially for complicated nonlinear oscillatory reactions. To explore these random, small-size effects, we used a cellular automata approach developed in our lab to simulate the chemical reactions probabilistically. In general, these simulations converged toward deterministic expectations as system size increased. Interestingly, our smallest systems appeared to oscillate more often and more prominently than theoretical predictions, and the average oscillation period was remarkably robust across system size. We also used our model to describe a stochastic reaction-diffusion system where concentration varied over space as well as time. Our results may have implications in the study of stochastic nonlinear dynamics; they are additionally relevant for complex reactions in the cell, such as circadian clocks. This framework may also be used in the future to study pattern formation, which has applications in cellular differentiation."

Kodera, T. James","The Continued Influence Effect (CIE) is the tendency to rely on misinformation even after an explicit correction has been provided. Resistance to the CIE has been found to correlate positively with working memory (WM) capacity, but a causal relationship has yet to be empirically tested. Additionally, no studies have yet addressed whether WM is critical while encoding new information, as proposed by the model-integration theory, or while retrieving stored knowledge, as proposed by the retrieval-failure theory. To fill this gap in the literature, the current study aimed to test a causal relationship between WM capacity and resistance to the CIE at encoding versus retrieval. Sixty-four Wellesley College undergraduates read a series of news article pairs containing misinformation that was later retracted or not, performed a distractor task, and answered a series of questions assessing the CIE. WM was divided using a continuous response task (CRT) at either encoding or retrieval. Results revealed decreased resistance to the CIE when WM was divided at encoding, supporting the model-integration theory; but were inconclusive when WM was divided at retrieval, providing no support for the retrieval-failure theory."
277,Promising and the Normative Landscape of Relationships,"Powers, Audrey",Philosophy,2020,"Matthes, Erich Hatala","Our most important interpersonal relationships are often the sites of our most meaningful promises, from the promises we extract from our parents as children in order to receive assurance from a position of little power to the promises we make to our partners in romantic relationship to negotiate the commitments we hold. Academic philosophy as a whole has generally paid too little attention to the social and moral significance of these promises, and the ways in which they shape our relationships. Promises allow us to, among other things, make lifelong commitments to other people and establish norms for the ways we treat each other in relationships. A promise to pick up ones partner at the airport after a flight gets in can result, on the most basic level, in a person getting picked up (or not picked up) at a terminal at an agreed-upon time. But such a promise can also set norms for how two people in a relationship demonstrate love and respect for each other, how they position themselves as committed and reliable, or, on the other hand, how they fail to do any of these things. Therefore, in this thesis, my aim is to explore the practice of promising within interpersonal relationships and begin to present an account of promising that appropriately privileges the function of promises as relationship norm-setting tools. In the first chapter, I will examine Mark Lance and Quill R Kuklas account of calls as it relates to promising in order to demonstrate the complexity of the ways in which we promise and respond to promises within our important relationships, and will examine a number of hypothetical cases of promising within relationships under Lance and Kuklas account. In the second chapter, I will consider the features of an account of promising that explains the importance of promising in relationships, and will come up with three desired criteria for an account of promising. These criteria relate to 1) the uptake given by the promisee, 2) the time over which the promise is made and accepted, and 3) the subject matter and content of promises in relationships (particularly in romantic relationships). In the third and final chapter, I will evaluate three accounts of promising – T.M. Scanlons expectational account, Seana Shiffrins rights-transfer account, and J.L. Austins speech act account – on the basis of my three desired criteria for an account of promising, and will conclude that Austins account, with some modifications, best explains (or is least likely to preclude the existence of) the relationship-related goods and ills that I see as an effect of promising."

Griffith, Alden
Jones, Kristina","Understanding connections among ecosystem nitrogen cycling, invasive insect defoliation, and tree recovery could facilitate the prediction of disturbance impacts across a range of spatial scales. In this study I investigated connections between ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling and a recent 2015-2018 irruption of invasive gypsy moth caterpillars (Lymantria dispar) which defoliate trees, causing stress and sometimes mortality with multiple years of defoliation. N is a critical nutrient that limits caterpillar growth as well as plant growth and recovery from defoliation. This study assessed the extent to which N availability impacted Lymantria dispar defoliation intensity and influenced tree recovery at the scale of individual trees and forest plots. To assess tree defoliation and recovery, I conducted field surveys of individual red oak (Quercus rubra) trees and forest plots nearby the Quabbin Reservoir, MA, where I measured leaf and soil N pools and soil N mineralization rates at individual trees and across the network of forest plots. I combined these data with remotely sensed data from Landsat and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Aerial Observation Platform (AOP) to assess relationships between landscape-scale defoliation and recovery and metrics of canopy N content. I found that leaves with lower N content experienced more intense herbivory by caterpillars than leaves with higher N. At the plot scale, forest areas with lower soil N were correlated with more severe L. dispar defoliation, which matched the tree-level trends. My results suggested that higher ecosystem N pools could promote the resistance of oak trees to L. dispar defoliation through an herbivory feedback where caterpillars consume less overall leaf mass for leaves with higher N and through a recovery feedback where trees with higher N could have more resources to rebound from herbivory. Better understanding the interactions among N, defoliation due to L. dispar caterpillars, and tree recovery could help to inform predictions of the impact and recovery trajectory of northeastern U.S. forests in response to future insect outbreaks."

Heynen, Arnold, Dr.
Montgomery, Daniel","Human sight is a gift powered by more than just the eyes, but also a complex neurological network. While the eyes collect visual input, the visual pathway of the brain serves to process, organize, and categorize visual information. The slightest disruption to any component of this pathway can have detrimental effects on vision. Amblyopia—more commonly known as lazy eye—is a common visual defect caused by a loss of vision in one eye due to asymmetric development of synapses carrying information from the eyes to the brain. Current exploration of novel amblyopia therapies requires accurate modelling of the impairment within a laboratory setting. This is most commonly done through monocular deprivation (MD) via eyelid suturing in mice. While effective in inducing amblyopia, eyelid suturing has several disadvantages including: an increase in eye pressure, eyelid scarring, and corneal damage. This project, therefore, proposes and tests two alternative monocular deprivation techniques: (i) a head goggle, and (ii) a blurred contact lens—to improve our current method of modelling amblyopia in mice. The efficacy of the head goggle and contact lens in occluding vision and, consequently, prompting an ocular dominance shift—a measure of amblyopia induction—were compared to that of an eyelid suture MD. Ultimately, the proposed MD techniques proved to be easier to implement and less invasive to the animal; however, failed to provide a decisive answer on their ability to model amblyopia. Results instead highlighted the challenges of local field potential experiments due to the movement of microelectrode implants during animal growth. As a result, the project's electrophysiological tests revealed electrical activity outside the brain region under study (i.e. the binocular region of the primary visual cortex). Future directions of this project will involve the use of larger animal group sizes and animals of older ages to mitigate the effects of implant movement. Finally, these results hope to encourage the exploration of alternative MD methods to improve our current amblyopia model."

Finnie, Peter
Bauer, Deborah","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading single-gene mutation associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS can manifest in early childhood with a variety of characteristics, including altered attention, visual processing, and sensitivity to sensory stimuli compared to typically developing individuals. FXS is linked to X-chromosomal silencing of the Fmr1 gene and subsequent loss of its product, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse has proven to be a useful model to understand how downstream effects of FMRP loss may contribute to observed phenotypes of cortical hyperexcitability, excess protein synthesis, altered LTP and LTD, and visual discrimination deficits. Because these phenotypes have been measured primarily ex vivo or behaviorally, we sought to identify a reliable in vivo neurophysiological assay for FXS in the Fmr1 KO mouse. Stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) is an electrophysiological readout of visual cortical plasticity upon exposure to familiar and novel stimuli. By varying visual stimulus parameters such as spatial contrast, grating orientation, and temporal frequency, we examined differences in both baseline visually evoked potential (VEP) magnitude and SRP acquisition in layer 4 of primary visual cortex. While Fmr1 KO mice displayed comparable orientation selectivity and SRP acquisition properties at lower temporal frequencies, they had markedly decreased VEP responses to high-frequency grating stimuli. Furthermore, flash stimuli elicited elevated responses in KOs regardless of temporal frequency, although pharmacological application of mGluR5 inhibitor CTEP to reverse this effect yielded inconsistent results. These findings nevertheless suggest differences in temporal frequency responsivity to high contrast visual stimuli, emphasizing the need for further research into possible cortical circuitry deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. This work will contribute to a better understanding of visual processing and synaptic plasticity, in the hopes of eventually translating in vivo electrophysiological phenotypes into reliable diagnostic tools for human patients with FXS."
282,The Motivations of Older Americans for Participating in High Commitment Climate Action,"Ostfeld, Jessica",Environmental Studies/Science,2020,"DeSombre, Beth
Turner, James Morton
Wink, Paul
Langridge, Suzanne","Action on climate change is urgently needed. For this to happen there needs to be increased climate activism. Presently, there is a large emphasis on youth climate activism, but there is another powerful activism force: seniors (65+). Many older individuals already care about climate change, but they participate in environmental action, and thus climate action, at particularly low rates (Pillemer et al., 2010). The climate action movement needs older individuals; they just need to be motivated. To recruit older individuals to climate action, climate action organizations need to understand what motivates seniors to participate. With sparse literature available on what motivates older individuals to climate action, this study investigates the motivations of older individuals (65+) already participating in high commitment climate action. Understanding the motivations of older individuals who are already highly committed to climate action should help climate action organizations recruit a potentially powerful demographic of activists. This study identifies the motivations for participation of older individuals in climate action organizations in the Boston area. The interviewees participate in organizations that range from large, national organizations to local town government committees. I interviewed thirty-three climate activists. During the interviews, I asked participants about what initially motivated them to begin their climate activism and what continues to drive it. I then transcribed these interviews and qualitatively analyzed for common motivational themes. It is important to note that all participating individuals are Caucasian, with some specifying a Jewish American ethnicity; most are comfortable financially; and all live in the relatively liberal Boston area in the Northeastern United States. The conclusions reached in this study may not extend to other demographics, and further research is needed into the motivations of older climate activists of color and from lower income brackets. For the studys demographic population, I identify seven common motivations of older individuals participating in climate action: concern about climate change, personal and moral identity, sense of purpose, legacy, social fulfillment, easy entry, and transition. Based on these, I provide recommendations for climate action organizations on how to better engage with older activists. All individuals interviewed had more than one factor that motivates their participation in climate action, but the most common one mentioned was concern about climate change. The individuals interviewed framed this in general and impersonal terms, likely due to sentiments that climate change wont have a big impact on their own lives, though they did express concern for their children and grandchildren. I recommend that organizations clearly communicate how they are addressing the climate concerns of potential and current members and provide space to discuss these. The second most common motivation for climate action mentioned by respondents was identity, both moral and personal. In psychology, personal identity refers to an individuals beliefs about who they are ""in terms of an individual's goals, values, and beliefs in areas such as political preference, religious ideology, occupational choice, family and friend relationship styles, and gender role ideologies"" (Schwartz et al., 2008, p. 636). Throughout the interviews, the individuals moral and personal identities were intertwined and varied. Some spoke of their identity as environmentalists, while others explained how their religious identity motivates climate action. There was no one common identity that motivated climate action. I recommend that climate action organizations take steps to help potential and current members identify what parts of their identities drive their desire to participate in climate action. This should help them further identify with climate action, thus increasing the likelihood of their continued participation. A sense of purpose was the third most common motivation mentioned by interviewees. Purpose has been defined by psychologists as ""a stable and generalized intention to accomplish something that is at once personally meaningful and at the same time leads to productive engagement with some aspect of the world beyond the self"" (Damon et al., 2003, p. 121). This sense of purpose was often expressed as derived from a desire to contribute to society and to the climate action movement. The feeling that they can contribute comes from a variety of sources: past work experience and skills, biographical availability, and a recognition of their own privilege. I recommend that climate action organizations take steps to help all members, potential and current, feel like they can and do contribute. The next most common motivation interviewees mentioned was a sense of legacy, or ""the impulse to care for those who come after"" (Frumkin et al., 2012, p. 1435). Many participants expressed that it is their concern about the world they are leaving to their grandchildren that drives their climate action. Some mentioned future generations in general, but more often this motivation was put in the context of grandchildren. Therefore, I recommend that climate action organizations provide opportunities for older individuals to include their children and grandchildren in their work. Many participants were also motivated to participate in climate action because of their need for social fulfillment, or friendships and a sense of community. This was a more common continuing motivation than initial, indicating that climate activism can provide social fulfillment to older generations. This is in the face of research that shows that older individuals perceive environmental activism less socially fulfilling than other forms of activism (Pillemer et al., 2010). It is therefore important for environmental organizations to emphasize the social fulfillment engagement with them can provide. I also identified that an easy entry can help facilitate and motivate the entry of older individuals into climate action. I define ""easy entry"" as when participants are easily connected to the organization of interest, meaning that they dont have to look hard to get involved. In the interviews, being introduced or invited to the climate action organization by a friend, seeing a flyer in the local newspaper, having the organization pop up in a Google search, were examples, among others, of easily accessed climate action. Often, an easy entry interacted with other reasons for climate action, such as a sense of purpose and social fulfillment. Easy entry may not be enough on its own to motivate climate action, but it positively interacts with other motivations to involve people in action. I then recommend ways that climate action organizations strive to make entry into activism as easy and accessible as possible. Finally, I found that often entry into climate action was associated with a transition, including retirement, the death of a loved one, or moving. Like easy entry, I found that a transition works with other motivations, such as concern about climate change and the desire for social fulfillment, to facilitate entry into climate action. I therefore provide suggestions on how to engage both the motivation a transition provides and other motivations for climate action. In sum, there is a wide variety of factors that motivate the climate action of older individuals. I hope the motivations identified and my recommendations based on them will help climate action organizations engage with more older individuals, strengthening the movement and bringing the swift action on climate change we need."

Lucia from Gaetano Donizettis 1835 opera, Lucia di Lammermoor, is a prime example of this doomed ending as she is driven to madness and death by the controlling men around her. However, Lucias fate stands out from others due to her unique liberation through madness. While the hysterics were used to tame her character at the end of the opera, now through a feminist lens, we can see how she was actually liberated through the madness—how she did not need to live by her family and societys rules and expectations in those moments of freedom."

This project studies the reentry and community-based services provided to formerly incarcerated women in Massachusetts. Reentry services attempt to reintegrate incarcerated individuals back into their own communities and greater society by means of employment access, housing options, addiction services and more. I analyzed qualitative data from collecting interviews from members of organizations and services that exist to serve women during their reentry process in Boston, Massachusetts. The narrative of reentry service providers revealed the expectations that are placed on incarcerated women to accomplish a level of emotional labor, as a way to access reentry resources. In addition, reentry service providers were found to fit into three typologies of thinking about the criminal justice system that influenced their provision of work — abolishment, rehabilitation and punishment."

It takes cleaned Source Extractor outputs of non-stationary detections from the images and finds tracklets representing asteroid motion within them. The linking software is a Python-based program that incorporates Find_Orb, an orbit determination program by Bill Gray. The bulk of the program identifies candidate tracklets based on exposure-to-exposure object movement. The program runs through all possible combinations of observation linkages, feeds possible tracklets through Find_Orb, and identifies candidate tracklets based on user-defined criteria including angular speed, angle between detections and mean residuals from Find_Orb. We tested the software with data from the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) survey and from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). For NEAT tests with artificial noise added, we found that the code performed ideally for noise levels up to 80%. In the PTF tests, we discovered a previously unreported asteroid position. Subsequently, we have submitted this tracklet to the Minor Planet Center. Our trials show that under ideal conditions, the linking software is able to perform on par with the linking capabilities of the NEAT and PTF systems, which have a more complex design."

App Inventor, for example, provides a BPE that helps programmers of all levels to build mobile device apps easily. However, visual blocks notations can make programs more difficult to read, write, edit, and share. Dual-mode environments that allow bidirectional conversion between isomorphic blocks and text representations can leverage the benefits of both modes. Having recognized the advantages of allowing textual editing as a plug-in in BPEs, I have designed Venbrace, a fully-braced textual syntax isomorphic to the blocks-based programming language in App Inventor, based on a collection of design principles. I implemented a lexer, a parser, and a syntax editor for Venbrace. To ensure the usability of Venbrace, I also developed, conducted, and did a preliminary analysis of the first round of a user study (with 17 subjects) to evaluate its initial syntax design, determine some design choices, and explore possible improvements. This project aims to (1) increase App Inventors general usability, (2) maximize the usability of Venbrace through user studies, and (3) confirm the benefits of evidence-based programming language design.

Among many other impacts, Google Search and its algorithms have a significant role in the information ecosystem. Often, when you do not know something, you search for the answer or relevant information by ``googling'' it. In response to your search query, Google returns a page filled with various pieces of information. Sometimes, among the results to your search, Google presents Top Stories --- a panel with news stories related to your search phrase. Out of thousands of news articles published daily on certain topics, Google chooses to present only ten articles. How does Google's algorithm make this choice? Are the articles or publishers shown to you ``better'' than others? What factors does Google consider to decide? In order to answer these questions, it is possible to conduct an algorithmic audit --- a thorough study that aims to understand algorithm and its choices. In this thesis, I present the results of conducting a longitudinal algorithmic audit of the Google's Top Stories algorithm. I worked with a dataset that contains a whole year of Top Stories that appear when one searches for the names of political candidates running for the 2020 US Presidential Election. My goal is to answer in an empirical way the question: What does a one-year-long audit of Top Stories reveal about the ways Googles algorithm shapes the public access to the online news coverage of political elections?"

The aim of this research is to develop a web-based navigation test in order to study the individual differences in navigation ability of a larger sample than used in previous research. To determine an individuals ability to create and update a ""mental map"" of new environments, the new measure asks participants to find the shortest path to various points around virtual environments created using the Unity game design platform. By creating and refining a new web-based measure, this research can provide future researchers with the tool they need to gain important insight into the psychology of individual differences, navigation ability and navigation strategy. Two rounds of testing and refinement of the new Virtual Navigation Test found the new measure to be a reliable measure of mental mapping ability. The results of the second study replicated the dissociation of self-reported and behaviorally measured navigation ability reported in prior research and the sex differences seen in prior research in navigation, initial evidence that the Virtual Navigation Test may be a valid test of mental mapping ability and navigating virtual environments."

In the semiconductor field, random walks are often utilized to model bulk transport of charge carriers. However, junction transport models generally rely on more complex numerical methods, which are computationally unwieldy and opaque to a general audience. To aim for greater accessibility, this thesis applies random walks to simulate carrier transport in p-n junctions. We first show that our random walk methods are consistent with finite-difference methods to model drift-diffusion processes. Next, we apply a basic random walk to model a p-n junction at equilibrium. This demonstrates successful proof-of-concept simulation of the depletion layer, as well as calculation of the the electric field and potential of a typical p-n junction. Additionally, because the basic random walk assumption cannot incorporate different mobility parameters for electrons and holes, we develop an improved compound p-n junction model. We demonstrate that the compound model is consistent with the basic model, and that it is adaptable to realistic material parameters for both electrons and holes."

Lucas, Margery
Pyers, Jennie
Kerr, Megan","The semantics and pragmatics of number words remain a longstanding debate among linguists and psychologists alike, as their interpretation across sentences is variable, resulting in at least, exactly, and even at most readings. Numerals can appear in many different grammatical roles in natural language, including predicative, arithmetical, quantifying, adjectival, and measure, further complicating their derived versus semantic meaning. Past research has focused on the meaning of numerals within a single language, primarily English. Differences in morpho-syntactic cues in the expression of plurality and negation in French versus English lead us to hypothesize that speakers of French might be more disposed to exactly N readings of numbers than English speakers in certain environments. First, we present an overview of the three main theories of the semantics of numerals, followed by an outline of the morpho-syntactic differences in the languages. We then provide a qualitative analysis of linguistic interviews with 5 native English speakers and 5 native French speakers. We use this qualitative data to better understand the use of number words in natural language, and to further evaluate the competing semantics theories. We conclude by appealing to the need for further cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research on the interpretation of number words in natural language."

We first study a partially ordered set representation of split graphs defined by Merris, connecting properties of poset elements, called blocks, to those of split graphs and vice versa. We also find an equivalence relation between poset elements, equivalent to changing the leaf vertices of a vertex of highest degree in a split graph, and provide results for when equivalence classes are closed under various conditions. In the second part of the thesis, we investigate an inverse operation on split graphs, giving proofs for previously stated results and establishing new propositions about the relationship between the inverse operation and unigraphs, induced subgraphs, and hereditary classes. In the third part of the thesis, we use Tyshkevich decomposition to give a structural characterization of the hereditary closure of the set of unigraphs. This characterization implies several results about the nature of forbidden induced subgraphs for the hereditary class."

Consequently, mobility route analysis and modeling is becoming increasingly important. Human mobility analysis and modeling is built on the intuition and observation that human mobility patterns demonstrate similarity across time and among crowds and are greatly affected by the landscape and transportation network, and that the similarities can be captured by a machine learned model. To aid in the discovery of human mobility patterns, I propose a new metric for quantifying the degree of similarity of movements that happen in the same time frame in a GPS trajectory datasets. The metric allows researchers to better understand the degree of spatio-temporal similarity between trajectories in a dataset. I then propose a new algorithm to extract important locations (Point of Interest) from trajectories, which effectively compresses the size of training data to be fed into machine learning models while accurately representing the real mobile patterns in the trajectories. I also propose a new algorithm for merging repetitive Points of Interest from different trajectories, so that the learning model can capture the similar mobile behavior among the crowd. Finally, I extend mobility modeling from individuals to the crowd, a topic that has been historically neglected in the mobile computing community. My design of training data parameters allows the model to generalize individual mobile behaviors and apply them to crowd mobility simulation."

This process is called imagined contact, and in this thesis I explored the impact of imagined contact on preschoolers implicit bias towards Black children. Participants were 28 children, aged 3 to 5 years old from a local daycare center. In session one, participants completed implicit bias measures. In session two, participants were divided into either the control group or the experimental group. The latter engaged in an imagined contact scenario with a Black child whereas the former imagined playing at a park. Effects on implicit bias were measured. Understanding preschoolers implicit biases can help guide how we talk about race in the classroom, and imagination has the potential to positively influence interpersonal relationships."

Recent empirical work has established, for example, that various forms of non-monetary incentives can make workers more satisfied, more likely to stay at the firm, and more productive (e.g., Cassar and Meier, 2018). However, little theoretical work is done to understand the role of general non-monetary incentives in organizations. Hence, this thesis intends to fill that gap by developing a sequence of four models based on Bakers multi-task framework (2002) to capture the effects of non-monetary incentives on employee behavior and wage design. I argue that non-monetary incentives can complement traditional monetary compensation to motivate effort. Such incentives can serve as a more efficient alternative to wages and solve many incentive problems caused by the limitations of a purely financial incentive contract, including adverse selection problems, moral hazard problems, and coordination failures."

Yet the narrative surrounding the American Revolutionary War makes it seem as though the other major actor in the conflict, Great Britain, only reacted to the events in the North American colonies and yielded no personal motives to ultimately declare war. Responsibility for deciding to go to war in 1775 is essentially removed from British pre-war political and military leaders. Limited discussion is held about the exogenous factors that would have influenced British decision makers. This thesis, however, seeks to fill that gap. It assesses how and why Great Britain's North American military strategy evolved the way it did. I map changes in strategy starting in 1768 when the first schooner, packed with British military forces, arrived in Boston Harbor until April 1775 with the march on Concord. Through three chapters looking at the important English personalities in charge of the military decision-making process, the actions of Great Britain's neighboring countries, and the strength of England's economy from 1768-1775, the nuances of the causes of warfare are discussed."

Hilt, Eric","In debates on abortion, individuals often align themselves with the pro-life or the pro-choice position, citing moral and philosophical arguments. While both sides raise valid and important points in defense of their views, it would also be beneficial to consider arguments based in the economics of fertility. My thesis studies the variation in abortion policies across eight Eastern European countries over the period of 1985 to 1995 to examine whether children born when access to abortion was heavily restricted have different outcomes than children whose parents had access to abortion at the time of conception. I also compare the outcome of the marginal child, who is not born when abortion is legal, but would be born if abortion were banned, to the outcome of the average child in its cohort (the child who would be born in either policy environment). Implementing a quasi-experimental empirical approach, I find that a child born in a year when abortion was legal only to save a mother's life is 1.6 percent more likely to graduate from primary school compared to a child born when abortion was available on request. Further, the marginal child is 14 percent more likely to graduate from primary school than the average child in its cohort. These results are consistent with a situation where even when abortion is available on request in a country, it remains accessible only to women of a more educated or affluent background. When abortion is banned, only these women have more children. Due to the new inflow of children from higher socio-economic backgrounds, on average, this cohort will graduate from primary school at higher rates. These findings contribute to existing evidence from Eastern Europe of the effect of abortion policy changes on the educational outcomes of children, as I rely on several abortion policy shifts in multiple countries. Thus, my thesis provides an interesting perspective on international abortion policy debates."

Can schools be sites of care in a time of neoliberalism? What theory of care would be most conducive to revitalizing schools as institutions of radical democratic citizenship? I turn to care because neoliberalism is fundamentally uncaring. Its presence in schools contributes to the attenuation of teachers' and students' ability to care. I discuss care as an ethic, practice, and a means of constituting new relationships in order to construct care as a versatile concept that might reinvigorate schools towards a democratic ethos and practice. I examine critical pedagogy and community organizing in schools as two potential examples of the power of care in order to argue that care can constitute schools as public and political places and students as democratic citizens."
332,The Tongues of Eve: The Politics of Language in Postcolonial Algerian Literature,"Hoyer, Molly",Comparative Literature,2018,"Aadnani, Rachid","Conflict in North Africa is often represented through a binary opposition between French and Arabic. Over the course of the almost 200 years since French colonization began in the region, these two languages have come to signify countless, contradictory elements of Algerian identity, history, and culture. This presentation will explore these language dynamics within the context of late 20th-century Algeria by analyzing two novels: So Vast the Prison by Assia Djebar and Memory in the Flesh by Ahlam Mosteghanemi. While each author wrote in a different language-Djebar in French and Mosteghanemi in Arabic-both manipulate narrative structure and style to explore representations of history, gender, national identity, and language in a postcolonial and feminist critique."

Most instrumental systems used for measurements of the suite of noble gases are expensive, low-throughput, and require laboratory support. Here we describe the development and optimization of a low-cost, high-throughput quadrupole mass spectrometer system for the measurement of noble gas ratios in water samples. This system is based around a Hiden 201 RC residual gas analyzer, which is coupled with a Bay Instruments membrane inlet for continuous gas extraction. This work is the first of its kind to use this particular membrane for measurements of noble gases; previously, these types of membranes have only been used in the study of other, more abundant gases. We evaluate the precision and accuracy of noble gas ratios as measured with this method. Our analysis of precision indicates that this instrument could be capable of measuring environmental samples if the most precise measurements could be consistently repeated. Preliminary data from accuracy experiments, however, suggests there is room for improvement before such a setup can be used in the field. Nevertheless, there are only a few other compact membrane-inlet QMS systems in development around the world, and our setup is already capable of measuring ratios more precisely and accurately than many of these analogous systems."
337,An Empirical Analysis of Prominent Theories on the Gender Promotion Gap: Evidence from Panel Data on Law Graduates,"Stern, Madeline",,2017,,"Women have unique, valuable information and insights that lead to their having different priorities and making different decisions than their male counterparts. Despite the fact that women have overtaken men in college attendance, there is a gender disparity in high powered positions that can be seen in many professions. Male and female lawyers, though exhibiting similar levels of competency, are promoted at different rates, exemplifying a trend throughout the world that is also closely related to the gender wage gap. The gender promotion gap is a topic that has been widely theorized upon, though never fully and satisfactorily explained. This paper assesses a wide array of proposed theories on the gender disparity in promotion using a single empirical dataset. I find that there is a 13 percentage point difference in promotion between men and women. Women may be subject to implicit, self-confirming bias that ends in an equilibrium where women, despite being of equal skill level, are promoted less frequently than their male counterparts due to task assignment early in their career. Male composition of firm does not affect task assignment, which contradicts theories on women's decision making. Controlling for task assignment does not reduce this gap as would be expected from prior literature. Ultimately, I find that the gap is reduced to 6 percentage points when controlling for billable hours, which are negatively affected by having children and spending time doing household chores. However, the persisting 6 percentage point gap remains unexplained."
338,Creativity as a Route to Attitude Change: Can the Creative Process Augment the Effectiveness of a Persuasive Message?,"Rieger, Agnes",Psychology,2017,"Hennessey, Beth","This study investigated the possibility that engagement in the creative process can augment the effectiveness of a persuasive message. Non-academic Internet use was used as the attitude change stimulus. The persuasive message was delivered via video, and the creative activity involved making a collage online. The creativity of the collages was later judged by a panel of experts following the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT). To the researcher's knowledge, no previous studies have attempted to investigate the creative and attitude change processes in combination. However, these two processes have important similarities in that both attitude change and creative outcomes are very much dependent on motivation, ability and effort, and both processes involve the formation of new connections and mechanisms of evaluation. Study results indicated that engagement in a creative process can, in fact, augment the effectiveness of a persuasive message. The argument is made that the mechanism behind this facilitative process is largely affective. An unexpected consequence of this study was the discovery that the vast majority of participants exhibited unusually problematic levels of Internet use. These findings are also discussed.

In contrast to temperature programmed desorption (TPD), a post-irradiation technique we have used previously to study methanol radiolysis, IRAS does not require thermal processing prior to product detection. Our goal is to simulate processes which occur when high-energy cosmic rays interact with interstellar and cometary ices, where methanol, a precursor of several prebiotic species, is relatively abundant. The interactions of high-energy radiation, such as cosmic rays (E max 10^20 eV), with matter produces large numbers of low-energy (< 15 eV) secondary electrons, which are thought to initiate radiolysis reactions in the condensed phase. Using IRAS we have found compelling evidence for the formation of ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH), formaldehyde (CH2O), dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and the hydroxyl methyl radical (•CH2OH) upon low-energy electron irradiation of condensed methanol at 85 K. We have also identified the same nascent radiolysis products following high-energy (900 eV) electron irradiation of condensed methanol, a finding which is consistent with the hypothesis that high-energy condensed phase radiolysis is mediated by low-energy electron-induced reactions. The observed formation of radiolysis products at electron energies below 10 eV demonstrates that electron impact ionization cannot be the sole reaction mechanism. The results of experiments such as ours may provide a fundamental understanding of how complex molecules are synthesized in the interstellar medium and comets. —Keywords: Cosmochemistry"

353,"The Gullah People, Justice, and the Land on Hilton Head Island: A Historical Perspective","Hazzard, Dominique T.",Environmental Studies/Science,2012,"Turner, James","The Sea Islands off the coast South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, also known as the Lowcountry, have been home to the Gullah-Geechee community for the past three centuries. The Gullah-Geechee people are African Americans who are descended from the enslaved people who worked the rice and cotton plantations in the Low Country region of Georgia and South Carolina, and who continue to live on the mainland and regions 'Sea Islands to this day. These people have a rich culture; more than any other African Americans, the Gullah-Geechee have been able to retain many aspects of West African culture, from language, to music, to land usage traditions. Unfortunately, the survival of the Gullah-Geechee currently is threatened by a variety of factors- social, economic, and environmental. Today, the people are faced with displacement from their traditional lands and the cultural traditions associated with that land due to the impacts of the rise of tourism and private residential communities. On no Lowcountry island are these challenges more apparent than on Hilton Head, an island off the coast of South Carolina that is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the South. The purpose of this thesis is to examine through a historical lens how the interaction of the Gullah people of Hilton Head island with the land has intersected and been impacted by changes to that land, the justice implications of those intersections, and how the story of the Gullah people and the development of Hilton Head for tourism and private residential communities can add to the literature of environmental studies, environmental justice, and the broader history of African Americans in the United States Between Reconstruction and the beginning of rapid development in the 1950s, the Gullah people of Hilton Head were both nourished and challenged by the land. As Union troops receded and the island slipped back into rural obscurity, the population plummeted from 40,000 in 1862 to less than 3,000 individuals in in 1868.(1) For the next fifty years, the Gullah people of Hilton Head Island would draw a living from the land, continuing to forge a unique sense of place and relationship with the land. In 1949, a Georgian real estate scout named Fred Hack and his neighbor Joseph Fraser, owner of the Fraser lumber company, journeyed to Hilton Head and became determined to harvest the island's substantial timber stands. They set up the Hilton Head Company that same year, purchased over two thirds of the island for $60 an acre, and set up lumber mills on the southern end of the island to begin harvesting pine.""(2) Charles Fraser later launched his own company, the Sea Pines Company, in 1957 with 5,000 acres of land and a determination to create a high class resort community on the southern tip of Hilton Head while preserving the area's natural beauty. Sea Pines, and the private residential communities Fraser built in its wake were incredibly successful; they set a trend on the Island of Hilton Head and throughout all of the Lowcountry. The politics of public and private space in America in the 1950s and 1960s the increasing obsession among White Americans with privatization, was a likely contributor to the popularity of these private enclaves. Ultimately, the growth of tourism and private residential communities that began at Hilton Head, compounded by the problem of heirs property and fundamental differences in conceptions of what land ownership even means, facilitated the marginalization of the Gullah-Geechee community throughout the Lowcountry. This marginalization has manifested itself in the erosion of the Gullah-Geechee people's land based traditions and threatened the community health of the Gullah-Geechee people. This is consistent with the literature; numerous scholars have documented that rural black communities with higher rates of land ownership have a stronger sense of community and a greater number of shared values and traditions.(3) From decreased ability to engage in traditional Gullah activities such as sweetgrass basket making, gardening, and fishing, to shifts away from community justice systems and towards a 'culture of servitude', reduced access to land and land ownership due to development can be directly connected to negative impacts on Gullah culture and community health. Fortunately, far from being passive victims of cultural erosion, the Gullah people have been actively striving to determine their own fate and write their own history during the past sixty years of development in the Lowcountry. Through education, legal action, and political and economic organizing on the local, regional, national, and international levels, the Gullah people have been able to assert agency and advocate for recognition and rights as a people. Perhaps one of the greatest examples of political resiliency that has arisen is the formation of the Gullah-Geechee Nation, a political representation of the Gullah-Geechee people's demands for agency, sovereignty, and respect. Another example is the Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, which was created in 2006, when the United States Congress passed the National Heritage Act of 2006 and designated the coastline from Wilmington, North Carolina to Jacksonville, NC as one of the nation's forty National Heritage Areas.(4) These successes can be seen as part of a recent trend of indigenous peoples gaining an increasingly powerful political voice at both the national and international level by implementing conscious political strategies around the traditional narratives of the endangered nature of their culturesΓ]- essentially, purposefully politicizing themselves, their culture, and particularly their land as a means of survival and advancing their interests by adopting a broad concept of community health. It can also be viewed as a call for the field of environmental justice to embrace issues regarding privately owned land, as well as a broader understanding of what it means to fight for community health. Generally, community health is discussed solely in terms of the physical health of individual members of the community. In the environmental justice literature, community health is usually discussed in terms of the disproportionate share of pollution and toxins with which marginalized communities are burdened. But I argue for a new understanding of community health; when evaluating the impact of environmental and land issues on communities, we must also incorporate cultural, economic, and political resiliency into the concept of community health. It is not only the health of a community's bodies that matters, but the health of their music, spiritual traditions, artistic and culinary expression, language, and independent economic means.

The present study explores the relations among personality (in particular, Maslow's construct of ""dominance-feeling""), sexual attitudes, and women's sexual behavior as an alternative explanation. Eighty-nine Wellesley College women reported their attitudes concerning casual sex, completed personality measures, and reported their past and expected number of sexual partners to investigate 1) whether or not Maslow's 1942 theory and measure of dominance-feeling apply to present-day women and 2) which personality traits are correlated with measures of attitudes toward casual sex and of previous sexual behavior. Dominance-feeling was found to be a reliable measure (α = .80) that correlated strongly with other relevant personality measures used, indicating that it still communicates modern concepts to college women. Dominance-feeling was, on average, the most strongly correlated with unrestricted attitudes and casual sex, with sensation-seeking as a close second. It is concluded that the construct of dominance-feeling in the present sample (which, with additional data, may extend to larger populations) provides a better, more full explanation for individual differences in sexual attitudes and behaviors than male-female differences alone. —Keywords: Sex (Psychology), Personality, Social psychology, Women college students -- Psychology"

The results indicate that the majority of the participants were aware of a math gender stereotype. Furthermore, participants also reported awareness of three different stereotype categories: traditional math gender, competitive, and negative personal characteristics. An association was found between stereotype category and college major, whereby a higher percentage of psychology majors reported awareness of both the traditional math gender and competitive stereotypes compared to neuroscience majors. Additionally, the stereotype category with which one reported an awareness had several implications, the most notable of which being that individuals who reported an awareness of a competitive stereotype also reported a higher mean level of work-related stress. A predictive relationship was also found to exist between the competitive stereotype category and work- related stress. The implications of these results are discussed. —Keywords: Stereotypes (Social psychology), Mathematics -- Study and teaching (Higher), Women college students -- Psychology, Sex differences, Competition (Psychology)"

The Effect of Parents' and Parents-in-law's Death on Beliefs about Mortality Risk,"Chen, Lizi",Economics,2013,,"In this paper, we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) panel, which surveys a representative sample of US seniors about their longevity prospects to examine whether the Bayesian assumption holds. Specifically, I test for (1) whether people's longevity predictions are responsive to new information, e.g., recent parental death which conveys information about genetic risks, lifestyle-related health risks, etc; (2) whether people's longevity predictions respond more to the arrival of precise information (parental death) than less clear information (parent-in-law's death); (3) whether the magnitudes of these updates are in accordance with theoretical predictions. We find that individuals' longevity predictions are responsive to new health-related information, and consistently more responsive to precise information (parental death) than imprecise information (parent-in-law's death). The magnitudes of these updates lie between the predicted lower and upper bounds of rational updates, but do not perfectly coincide with the predicted values and are sensitive to model specifications. We conclude that there is no strong evidence against the Bayesian assumption. We point out that the Bayesian assumption is only one aspect of the rationality hypothesis. From qualitative survey data, We find evidence of inattention to government subsidy of long-term care insurance, mistaken beliefs that long-term care is covered by Medicare and tendency to procrastinate on long-term care insurance purchasing decision. The evidence suggests irrationality may cause individuals to under-insure through these other venues."

Teixeira, Ana Catarina","This work analyzes the official political discourse and gender ideology of Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy and Salazar's right-wing dictatorship in Portugal. The first two chapters are dedicated to a closer examination of how the two political leaders viewed woman's role in Italian and Portuguese society, respectively, what reasons they gave to justify their stance on gender (un)equality and how the general public responded to the gender politics the two regimes embraced. While Mussolini's and Salazar's dictatorships were both on the right end of the political spectrum and shared nationalistic characteristics, in my analysis, I aim to draw the reader's attention to the differences that set the two dictators apart. The third chapter is a literary exploration of the work of two female authors: the Italian Alba de Céspedes and the Portuguese Maria Archer. Both were important literary figures in their countries during the respective dictatorial regimes, and both represented in their work outlooks on women's social roles that did not match the vision imposed by the political regimes. Alba de Céspedes and Maria Archer exposed facets of Italian and Portuguese women's daily lives that questioned the all-encompassing nature of the subaltern role that the regimes sought to circumscribe women into. By working closely with de Céspedes' novel Nessuno torna indietro and Maria Archer's short story ""Mulher por conta"" I examine the aspects of the female condition in Italy and Portugal that the two writers exposed but that Mussolini's and Salazar's official discourses did not openly address."

In a pretest, children (17 boys, 15 girls) aged 39 to 61 months were presented with pairs of gender-neutral toys and asked to state their toy preference for each pair. The same children, in a separate session, were introduced to puppets that specifically liked the version of the toy the children originally did not like, either with or without a teacher puppet present. The puppet stated reasons why that toy was better. Children were then asked which version of the toy they preferred. Whether children changed their preferences or maintained their original choice was recorded. Results indicated that neither boys nor girls were more influenced by a boy puppet or a girl puppet (p > .05). Additionally, the presence of a teacher did not affect the amount of influence the puppets had over the children (p > .05). Overall, the findings provide evidence that children are not affected by the gender of the puppets and the presence of a teacher in gender-neutral situations."

As China transitioned from empire to modern nation-state in the twentieth century, new forms of identity emerged. Sino-Muslim intellectuals held different views about whether all Muslims in China comprised one nationality or were ethnically different while sharing one common religion. This internal debate provides the key to understanding how the terms ""Hui"" and ""Huizu"" underwent the curious transformation from a religious to an ethnic marker.

Gleason, Tracy","Episodic memory and future thinking are crucial capacities that emerge and undergo substantial development during the preschool years. However, their relationship has rarely been examined in tandem within development. Narratives were elicited from 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children (n = 36) to assess episodic memory and future thinking. The richness of children's memory and imagined future episodes was measured by the number of episodic details in their narratives. Non-narrative measures of episodic memory and future thinking were also administered. As hypothesized, children's ability to recall personal events and generate possible future events underwent substantial development during the preschool years on three of the four memory and future thinking tasks, with the exception of narrative future thinking. Nevertheless, narrative memory and narrative future thinking remained correlated even after controlling for working memory, inhibition, verbal ability and narrative fluency. These results suggest the possibility of a common neurocognitive basis underlying narrative memory and narrative future thinking in preschool development. Mental time travel and scene construction are identified as possible common mechanisms underlying this relationship. —Keywords: Memory in children, Cognition in children"

In the absence of any truly developed theory of still life, Claesz and Chardin provide a commentary on still-life painting by reacting to the paintings of their predecessors. In doing so, these two artists attempted to elevate the genre of still life by foregrounding artistry through brushstroke and subject matter, creating still lifes that are more than pure imitation. The works of Claesz and Chardin show how still life can bring both creativity and skill into still life and create an intimate world for the viewer."
377,How Women Experience and Embody Privilege in Elite Liberal Arts Colleges,"Gutierrez, Priscilla Devon",Sociology,2013,"Rutherford, Markella
Cuba, Lee","Researcher Shamus Khan (2011) understands ""privilege"" as the ability to be at ease in a multitude of social situations and to function facilely within these situations. While it is a skill proven to be desirable in both school and the job market, only certain lifestyles and institutions, such as elite boarding schools, have traditionally fostered its development. My thesis research looks at the experience and embodiment of privilege among female students on elite liberal arts college campuses, both single-sex and co-educational. Using longitudinal data from the New England Consortium on Assessment and Student Learning (NECASL), I compare the ways in which female students of different races/ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses experience and acquire privilege. Ultimately, I conclude that elite college students of all backgrounds express privilege similarly and effectively because colleges admit students who either have the appropriate dominant habitus or are very close to achieving it.

Whitman acted as a pioneer by carving out a niche for women artists who chose to avoid the male-dominated, hierarchal sphere of nineteenth-century fine arts. Instead, she turned to producing cloth-stamped book covers and works in stained glass and is credited as the first person to procure full-time employment as a book designer. My paper will use Sarah Wyman Whitman's life and work to explore how her social networks of Boston artists, authors, and reformers shaped her work across media and illuminate a variety of issues facing women artists during this period in the context of the fine press revival in Boston, the gender politics of craft, and notions of feminine sensibility."
390,The Village and the City: Imagining and Building Post-Independence India,"Naka, Ikuno",International Relations,2012,"Rao, Nikhil","Since independence in 1947, India has seen the creation of ambitious new postcolonial cities and rural development projects throughout. Underscoring many of these rural and urban planning projects was a new 20th-century understanding of the built environment as being connected to a nation's society, economy and politics. The redevelopment of India's built environment was part of a larger utopian project of changing India's condition of underdevelopment; a means of broadcasting that Nehruvian assumption of nationhood outwards. There were two projects in particular that were pioneers of their time. The first is the redevelopment of the rural agricultural villages of Uttar Pradesh. The second is creation of the new capital city of northern India, Chandigarh. Both projects were a means to move forward from India's past so often associated with its ""backwardness"", and assert itself, in the most physical and obvious way, as a modern nation-state to its citizens and to the greater international community. —Keywords: Cities and towns -- India -- History -- 20th century, India -- Politics and government -- 20th century"

I examine the early institutional history of the Texas Rangers in the light of new scholarship on Texas Native American groups, especially the Comanche, and expose the myth-making inherent in the organization's earliest history. Close readings of two specific Westerns that focus on Texas Ranger figures, Nelson Lee's Three Years Among the Comanche and Zane Grey's The Lone Star Ranger, further explicate later historical processes. Lee's falsified memoir is placed in the broader national context of Westward expansion leading up to the Civil War, and Grey's novel is put in dialogue with Theodore Roosevelt's contemporaneous manipulation of Western ideologies in service of American imperialism. Taken together, the cultural work that Westerns and Texas Ranger figures do is clarified and contextualized--especially their role in supporting constructions of race, gender, and class. In this way, early Western fiction shows the fiction of the whiteness and masculinity espoused by the Texas Rangers. —Keywords: Texas Rangers -- In popular culture, Texas -- History -- 19th century, Nelson Lee (b. 1807), Zane Grey (1872-1939).

The analysis of 20 qualitative interviews with students at an elite liberal arts college highlights the complex relationship between socioeconomic status and education. Interviewees discuss the fields they encountered and the capital they accrued as they formed a habitus that was continuously being shaped by their experiences. These factors contributed to the trajectories that students followed as they developed high aspirations and continued on to university. A comprehensive analysis of this largely social process accentuates the inadequacies of educational policy that focuses on formal rather than informal processes of learning and education."
394,Educating for Femininity? Reform of Working and Middle Class Girls' Education in Victorian England,"Dowdall, Daisy",History,2014,"Kapteijns, Lidwien
Slobodian, Quinn","Working and middle-class girls' education underwent significant reform in Victorian England. These reforms have been widely studied, with scholars divided into two broad historiographical schools: one that emerged in the late 1970s and places emphasis on the theory behind the reform to argue that little changed, and one that developed around 1990 and focuses on tangible practical change to demonstrate that a transformation did indeed occur. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge the gap between these two bodies of scholarship, examining the significance of girls' educational reform from the subjective positions of some working-class and middle-class girls, as expressed in their memoirs. It demonstrates that while conservative attitudes regarding both the fundamental purpose and overall utility of girls' education persisted (and indeed, remained prevalent) well into the late 19th century, major reforms within schools significantly altered the school experience for the majority of Victorian girls. These reforms drastically changed not only the educational but also the occupational landscape for young Victorian and Edwardian women. Thus this study concludes that girls' educational reform, while not completely transformative, did transform the lives of many individual women."

398,Improving the Usability of App Inventor through Conversion between Blocks and Text,"Chadha, Karishma",Computer Science,2014,"Turbak, Franklyn","In blocks programming, users compose programs by combining visual fragments (blocks) shaped like jigsaw-puzzle pieces. The shapes suggest how the blocks fit together, reducing syntactic frustrations experienced by novices when learning textual programming. MIT App Inventor 2 (AI2), a popular online environment for Android app development, democratizes programming through its easy-to-use blocks language. However, while simple blocks programs are easy to read and write, complex ones become overwhelming. Creating and navigating nontrivial blocks programs is tedious, and AI2's current inability to copy blocks between projects inhibits reusing blocks code or sharing blocks code with others. To address these issues, I have created a new textual language, TAIL, that is isomorphic to AI2's blocks language and provided a means for converting between them. TAIL syntax is designed to provide users with a systematic way to translate the visual information on the blocks into text. I have extended AI2 with a set of code blocks (for expressions, statements, and top-level declarations) in which users can type TAIL code representing I2 blocks. These code blocks have the same meaning as the larger block assemblies they represent. Programmers can also convert back and forth between these code blocks and the original AI2 blocks. Language isomorphism guarantees that a round-trip conversion (from text to blocks and back, or blocks to text and back) begins and ends with the identical program. To implement the TAIL language, I wrote a grammar for the ANTLR parser generator to generate a JavaScript lexer and parser for TAIL. I use actions in the grammar to translate the TAIL parse tree into AI2's XML tree representation for blocks. This project aims to (1) increase AI2's usability by providing an efficient means for reading, constructing, sharing, and reusing programs, and (2) ease users' transitions from blocks programming to text programming."

It is a rare jewel of the art song repertoire because of its genre: it is one of the first of few orchestral song cycles ever to be composed, and the only one from nineteenth century France that is well known today. Another fascinating aspect of the work is its unconventional origin: it was initially composed for voice and piano in 1840-1841, and not fully orchestrated until 1856. Without question, the orchestral version has been the work to withstand the test of time; though the piano-voice version represents Berlioz's original vision for the songs, it is rarely performed and far less admired today. It is Berlioz's masterful orchestration that sent the initially admired piano version into obscurity and propelled the orchestral version into the limelight in the decades following his death. My thesis explores Berlioz's reasons for composing and orchestrating Les nuits d'été. I will compare the text settings of the orchestral version to those of the original with piano accompaniment in order to understand exactly how Berlioz used the orchestra to express the text. For the performance portion of my thesis, I will perform Les nuits d'été in the context of my Senior Voice Recital. I use the orchestral piano-reduction in preparation for a future performance of the work with orchestra. The detailed analysis of Berlioz's songs- from historical and critical perspectives as presented here- shape my performance."

App Inventor lowers barriers for novices by providing visual guidance for understanding programs and by reducing common programming errors, but it does not eliminate errors entirely. Preliminary analysis of the users' runtime errors shows that better debugging tools for AI2 are needed. People often encounter the same error or a series of errors before they find a solution or give up. I have implemented AI2 features to help programmers pinpoint the source of runtime errors. In live development mode, AI2 users can test on their devices blocks programs written in a web browser on their computer. Previously, often cryptic runtime error messages were displayed in a dialogue box in the browser window. With my changes, more meaningful runtime error messages are displayed on the block causing the error. I have also implemented a watch feature that allows users to track values of variables and expressions. My version is an improved version of the watch from App Inventor Classic. I have also implemented the means to collect more meaningful data on users errors. Currently, runtime error reports in live development mode are automatically stored in a cloud database. The reports include only the error message, the time of the error, and the device on which it was generated. I have augmented the error reports to include the current program code and its author. This extra information can be used to better understand who generates errors, why they are generated, and how users try to fix them. This information will support better debugging and, in the future, can be a basis for an intelligent debugging tutor."

Skeath, Susan
Chang, Stanley","A ""tontine"" is a special kind of annuity in which all participants contribute equally to a subscription pool, and a fixed percent of the total capital raised is distributed equally among surviving nominees every year. In this paper, we examine the adverse selection in the Irish tontines of 1773, 1775 and 1777 because of the presence of a group of speculative investors, namely a group of Genevan bankers. These Genevan investors purportedly cherry picked nominees with greater expected longevity. Their existence allows us to study a rather unconventional aspect of adverse selection, which arises from the informational asymmetry among different types of buyers. Using a newly compiled data set on the nominees and their subsequent mortality, we estimate that these Genevan investors earned on average 8.5% more per share than the other subscribers of the Irish tontines. The result suggests that speculative investors with access to superior information may earn higher returns at the expense of average investors, a phenomenon implicit but difficult to quantify in other insurance markets."

I define environmental justice as the meaningful participation in the development of the environment and the fair access to that environment across peoples regardless of difference. Although gaining traction in other global cities, environmental justice has not been considered in Indian cities because the conceptualization of the ""environment"" is pragmatically restricted to rural areas. I ground this thesis in three core arguments: (1) the natural environment and built environment exist in a hybrid form in both cities and rural areas; (2) by ascribing agency to both the natural and the built components of hybrid environments, it is possible to qualify their nexus as it impacts the human experience; (3) problems that are commonly understood as social injustices are shaped by this natural-built environment (NBE) nexus, and must therefore be reconstructed as environmental injustices. By studying Bangalore's development using the NBE nexus framework, I am able to understand the city's dichotomies on a deeper level, as inextricably linked to its environment in both causes and solutions. Chapter 1 places Bangalore in a global context, establishing it as a relevant and useful case study for understanding urban environments and injustice worldwide. In Chapter 2 and 3, I analyze the history of Bangalore's urban and rural NBE nexuses, respectively, in order to understand the injustices that have persisted through today. In Chapter 4, I analyze Ejipura Slum, a dramatic example of how Bangalore's NBE nexus creates a negative urban experience for poor people. I conclude with a case-study-based exploration of potential strategies for mitigating environmental injustice and reimagining the NBE nexus to be sustainable and just for all."

For the past decades, we have benefited greatly from its technological improvement. To accurately measure the contribution of such technological improvement to economic growth, we need a quality adjusted price index, which also helps us understand quality and technology trends in microprocessors. The quality trend in desktop microprocessors has been extensively studied. I focus on microprocessors for laptops for my senior economics thesis. Using data I newly collected on laptop microprocessor prices and performance metrics, I construct a quality adjusted price index spanning the past ten years. Across a range of empirical specifications, I find a sharp decrease in quality adjusted price over 2004-2013, but smaller in magnitude since 2010. These results might suggest a different technological improvement pattern and/or changing pricing strategies in the laptop microprocessor segment of the industry."

Political Science",2014,"Elkins, Sharon","One in six hospital patients in America are treated at a Catholic hospital, and in the last three years at least 20 Catholic hospitals have merged with secular ones. Catholic-affiliated hospitals must abide by the United States Council of Bishops' Ethical and Religious Directives, and merged hospitals are frequently required to follow these directives. One of the core set of directives, having to do with ""the beginning of life,"" do not allow any Catholic-affiliated hospitals to offer a range of reproductive services, including abortions, contraceptives, and sterilizations. As a result of mergers, formerly secular hospitals frequently have to adopt the directives. However, the directives are often applied in an ad hoc manner, and hospital administrators and doctors sometimes attempt to circumvent them in confusing and roundabout ways. Ultimately, Catholic-secular hospital mergers lead to a variety of legal challenges, most of which are successful on the basis of medical malpractice laws."

Participants read the closing arguments of a lawyer in a case involving libel. I hypothesized that female attorneys would be less influential than male attorneys would overall, and especially in conditions where the attorney is older and the goal is agentic. To test this hypothesis, participants were randomly assigned to read a statement made by either a male or a female attorney, who was either 30 or 55 years old, as indicated through a biographical note. Additionally, the note specified that the attorney was either working for compensation and thus had an agentic goal (focused on the self), or was working pro bono and thus had a communal goal (focused on the community). After reading the attorney's argument, participants evaluated the attorney and the attorney's message. Overall, the perceived competence and persuasiveness of the attorney was the most influential characteristic affecting opinion. Male participants perceived female attorneys as more competent than male attorneys, and female participants perceived male attorneys as more competent than female attorneys. Thus, men were more persuaded by female attorney, and women were more persuaded by men."

Mathematics",2013,"Miwa, Julia H.","Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors and motors deficits, caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the resulting dopamine depletion in the brain. Examination of the substantia nigra of the brains of Parkinson's patients reveals abnormal intraneruonal deposition of fibrillar aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein. While Parkinson's disease is generally idiopathic in origin, several mutations in alpha-synuclein have been shown to increase the likelihood of the disease. This further implicates alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. This report focuses on wild type alpha-synuclein. A 31-residue peptide corresponding to residues 6-36 of the N-terminus of alpha-synuclein was synthesized, purified, and its conformation examined using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The peptide showed conformational behavior that is similar to what has been found for this region in the full-length protein. Thus, the peptide can be used as a model system for the N-terminal region of alpha-synuclein. In future work, this peptide model and its A30P mutant counterpart can be compared to characterize the role of this mutation in Parkinson's disease."
426,Analysis of Rat Event Related Potentials in Frontal and Parietal Lobes as a Possible Neural Correlate of Attention in Passive Oddball and Active Go/No-Go Paradigms,"Imada, Allicia",Neuroscience,2013,,"Event related potentials (ERPs) are often used to examine normal human attention and to assess attentional impairments in neurological and mental disorders (Linden, 2005, Jahshan et al., 2012). To better understand sensory and attentional processing in the rat, ERPs were recorded from medio-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal areas while the animals were exposed to passive and active auditory attentional paradigms. The passive oddball paradigm was designed to target bottom-up stimulus-driven attention, while the active go/no-go paradigm was designed to evoke top-down goal-driven attention. In the passive paradigm rare-tone enhancements were seen in frontal and parietal N1, P2, N2, P3E, P3L peak amplitudes that overall could not be accounted for by stimulus specific adaptation (SSA). In the active paradigm N2 peaks showed a trend toward being larger during lick trials in general as well as specifically in false alarms, while P2 in hit trials and P3 in miss trials showed trends toward being larger. Licking might therefore affect ERP peaks by increasing N2, while attentional processing in the active paradigm might manifest itself as larger P2 on hit trials and perhaps as larger P3 on misses and N2 on false alarms. The active paradigm produced larger amplitude ERP components in general than the passive paradigm, in agreement with other studies (Shinba, 1997, Sambeth et al., 2003, Wronka et al., 2008, Hattori et al., 2010). Active N2 and P3 peak latencies were longer than those in the passive condition, which is also in agreement with other studies (Ritter et al., 1983, Katayama and Polich, 1999, Folstein and Van Petten, 2008, Wronka et al., 2008). Active and passive tasks do seem to elicit different ERP peaks, but the similarities between these differences in rats and humans is still unclear. Overall our results help extend the correspondence between human and rat sensory processing, while also beginning to identify species differences."

Alongside these figures, patrons like the Comtesse Greffulhe, the Princesse de Polignac, Misia Sert, and Coco Chanel contributed greatly to the ballet troupe in four different ways. Yet very few scholars have recognized these women for their significant contributions to the musical, artistic, and financial aspects of the Ballets Russes.

Drawing on writings about Orientalist media depictions, my analysis of print advertisements shows that Orientalism is still evolving. While older forms of Orientalism offer Western constructions of the East with exoticized nostalgia or ""yellow peril,"" new forms use Asian bodies to represent the East within the West with continued and adapted stereotypes. I find that, while Asian bodies have gained proportional and inclusive representation, contemporary print advertising still positions them as marginal. I argue that Asian models are used to signal edginess, affluence, and futurism, but in a way that invokes the model minority stereotype."

However, the degree of cooperation and the enforcement mechanisms in place to sustain cooperative behaviors vary dramatically across countries. This paper investigates the impact of institutions on social cooperation. Furthermore, we explore the way in which the framing of a decision interacts with institutional norms to result in different levels of cooperation. We run a controlled laboratory experiment in which participants are randomly exposed to either a ""strong"" or ""weak"" institutional environment and then asked to participate in a social dilemma, modeled as a public goods game and framed as either ""giving"" to or ""taking"" from a common project. Experimental results indicate that institutions have an impact on cooperative behavior in the social dilemma. Specifically, we find that participants exposed to a strong institution cooperate at a higher rate than participants assigned to a weak institution condition, and that these differences increase over time through learning. Further, we find that being in the taking frame generates higher rates of free-riding in the public goods game, relative to the giving frame, although it is not significantly related to the total level of contributions to a common project. Finally, we find that the interaction of framing and institutional history has a significant impact on cooperation specifically through free-riding in the public goods game."

Koldewyn, Kami
Conway, Bevil","It has been proposed that the processing of faces is a highly specialized function that is separate from the processing of other types of objects. Evidence for this appears with inversion, where it has been observed that face recognition is more affected than the recognition of other types of stimuli (Diamond and Carey, 1986). From these observations it can be inferred that holistic processing of faces makes face analysis unique. This thesis focuses on the question of whether configural information encoded in a face can be used quickly to determine the animacy of a face, or if a more detailed analysis of face features is necessary. By animacy we mean whether the image portrays a real human face or that of a ""human-like"" inanimate object such as a doll or a manikin. In the first part of this thesis face morphs between doll and human faces were inverted to see if animacy perception of faces would be affected with less configural information. In the second part of the thesis, the time-course of animacy perception in relation to face recognition is analyzed. The final part of the thesis examines the role of high and low spatial frequency ranges in encoding information used for animacy judgment. The results from the first experiment suggest that holistic processing of the face is necessary for animacy perception. From the temporal experiment it can be deduced that animacy perception occurs more quickly than face recognition, and may require less detailed face analysis. The results from the spatial frequency pilot experiment suggest that removing the high spatial frequencies or low spatial frequencies from the face images has no effect on animacy perception, however, more data is needed in order to form a strong conclusion."

446,Regulation of levels and localization of thimet oligopeptidase in prostate cancer cells by β-estradiol,"DeFries, Christa",Biological Chemistry,2013,"Wolfson, Adele J.","The enzyme thimet oligopeptidease (TOP) catalyzes the hydrolysis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in vitro, and evidence suggests that TOP is the primary enzyme responsible for GnRH hydrolysis in vivo, as well. If this is true, TOP could play an important role in regulating steroid hormone production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In addition to its function at the level of the hypothalamus, TOP may also have a direct effect at the target tissue level. In order to determine if TOP has a direct modulating effect androgen and estrogen functions, prostate cancer cells were treated with estradiol, an end product of the HPG axis. If TOP and steroid hormones comprise a feedback loop, treatment with estradiol could regulate TOP levels, localization or activity. After estradiol treatment, TOP staining was imaged confocally in prostate cancer cells. TOP was also detected and quantified in cell lysates by immunoblot. Quantification of TOP staining in prostate cancer cell images suggested that estradiol treatment increased cellular TOP levels and also increased nuclear TOP levels in particular. However, Western analysis showed that overall TOP levels varied very little with estradiol treatment. Although not definitive, these results indicate that TOP responds differently with direct treatment of prostate cancer cells by estradiol as compared to estradiol treatment within the context of the HPG axis."
447,"Exploration of the Neurochemistry, Structural Morphology and Behavior in the GCPII+/- Mouse Model with Magnetic Resonance","Mouradian, Palig",Neuroscience,2013,,"Schizophrenia plagues approximately 1% of the world's population. This chronic brain disorder is marked by behavioral, cognitive and social abnormalities. Studies on the brain pathophysiology of schizophrenia have also found predominant structural and neurochemical aberrations. While no single cause of the disorder has been identified; environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors have been implicated. This thesis is both an investigation of the genetically modified GCPII+/- mouse model as well as the groundwork for the implementation of diffusion tensor imaging and an updated epigenetic mouse model. Groundwork for the updated mouse model included rodent stereotactic surgery design to ultimately induce epigenetic dysregulation with hopes of better modeling the variable development and symptomology of schizophrenia. The primary GCPII+/-mouse model sustains decreased expression of the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) integral for glutamate synthesis in order to diminish glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. Magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy and a social task were used to test for the abnormalities that GCPII+/- might exhibit. Tests were conducted on both mice heterozygous for GCPII+/-mutation (HET) and their wild-type (WT) counterparts at numerous ages corresponding to mouse adolescence and adulthood. We hypothesized that HET mice would exhibit differential volume of brain structures and neurometabolites compared to WT mice, as well as social deficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) data were obtained on post natal days (PND) 35/36, 49/50 and 63/64 and social task data were obtained between PND 114 and 117. Both MRI and MRS data revealed sex differences. HET males exhibited more structural abnormalities than HET females with greater hippocampal asymmetry and decreased right hippocampal volume compared to WT males. Ventricular enlargement or asymmetry was not reported in HET males nor females. HET females exhibited more abnormalities in neurometabolite levels with elevated levels of choline and glutamate, as well as diminished levels of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate compared to WT females. Behavioral data found that both HET males and females exhibit a social deficit. Each sets of results mirrored findings in MRI and MRS studies on schizophrenia as well as characteristic social abnormalities. Data serve as a testament to the promise of the GCPII+/- mouse model but are also indicative of the model's shortcomings."
448,Using Optogenetics to Causally Test the Role of Local Gamma Synchrony in Downstream Sensory Responses,"Salehi, Kia",Neuroscience,2013,"Wiest, Mike","Conscious processes such as attention and sensory awareness have been associated with neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-90 Hz). However, it remains unclear whether gamma rhythms play a functional role in sensory routing or are merely a byproduct of computation. Optogenetics has recently made it possible to manipulate synchrony exclusively in vivo. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that local gamma synchrony plays a functional role in routing sensory responses between brain regions, we launched an optogenetics protocol in mice to induce gamma synchrony in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and measure somatosensory responses in frontal cortex (M2). To test the feasibility of our experimental setup we also carried out recordings in control mice and analyzed the relationship between spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus S1 gamma synchronization and M2 response amplitudes. Our pilot experiments confirmed our ability to elicit and record sensory responses in anesthetized mice but initial analyses reveal no correlation between S1 synchrony and M2 response amplitude. Preliminary optogenetic experiments were unsuccessful in inducing synchrony but revealed the possible causes of the problem and the steps necessary to address them. Once we can successfully manipulate synchrony we can apply the analyses developed for control recordings to address the question of whether gamma synchrony modulates interarea signal transmission in the brain."

Arumainayagam, Christopher
Elmore, Don","In this project, we systematically use several computational techniques such as charge optimization and component analysis to study molecular recognition and binding in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) drug systems. Using CML drugs and their biological target, the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, we systematically conduct a comparative analysis on five CML drugs bound to both the wild-type (WT) and T315I mutant Abl kinase. While early generation drugs (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) interact with Thr315 via a hydrogen bond, novel drugs ponatinib and PPY-A bypass interacting with Thr315 altogether. With the mutation to Ile at position 315, early generation drugs may experience a significant loss in favorable binding due to loss of electrostatic interaction and introduction of steric hindrance. To investigate the differential binding of these drugs to the WT and mutant, we optimize each of the drugs to the Abl kinase, allowing us to study how each drug binds to the native form. We also optimize PPY-A and ponatinib to the mutant T315I, comparing this charge distribution with the one generated from optimizing to the native form. Using component analysis, we identify chemical moieties of each drug that contribute favorably or unfavorably to the electrostatic free energy of binding. Taken together, we hope that by studying CML drugs, we will gain some insight into the larger picture of electrostatic binding interaction and potentially provide future direction for rational drug design and battling drug resistance."

Wilmer, Jeremy
Mustafaraj, Eniana","In order to navigate through the environment, recognize objects, and interact physically with object surfaces, we need to recover the 3-D layout of a visual scene from the 2-D images that are projected onto the eyes. A primary cue used by the human visual system to perceive the depths of surfaces in the scene is stereo disparity (Marr & Poggio, 1979; Howard & Rogers, 2002; Brown, Burschka, & Hager, 2003; Harris & Wilcox, 2009). Stereo disparity arises from the difference in perspective provided by the two eyes. As a result of this difference, objects can appear at slightly different positions in the left and right images. The human visual system is able to detect this disparity in position and use it to infer depth (Figure 1). For tasks such as the recognition and manipulation of objects in the scene, it is important to segment the image into regions that belong to distinct objects. A strong cue to the presence of an object boundary is a large change in depth between two adjacent image regions. Stereo processing enables the detection of these boundaries and computation of the relative depth between surfaces meeting at boundaries in the image."

459,Statistical Analysis of Simple Martian Impact Crater Morphometry,"Geiger, Lynn M.",Astronomy,2013,"Watters, Wesley Andres","Mars, a planet with a tenuous atmosphere and starved of surface water, is a prime location for studying impact craters. Earth's thick atmosphere stops small craters from forming, and erosion destroys the craters that do. The size range of Martian craters is much greater and craters last much longer than terrestrial craters. The variety of Martian terrain makes it possible to study effects of geology on crater morphology and crater modification, making Mars a much more interesting study location than the Moon. In this project, we investigate the effects of crater size and target geology on crater shape for small (D < 5km), simple impact craters. For example, we see morphometry differences between Vastitas Borealis, sedimentary rocks and volcanics. In addition, we investigate changes in morphology between fresh and modified craters. To study craters on a global scale, we adapted computer programs to generate digital elevation models using stereo images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and developed new software and algorithms to extract crater rim traces and crater shape statistics automatically. We show that moderate crater age has no apparent effect on rim roundness, and that crater flank elevation profiles in the Northern lowlands have lower power-law decay exponents (αF≤-4) than the global distribution (αF≤-6). We identify a possible crater shape transition at D ≈ 300m to increased rim sharpness. Our results show geologic dependence on crater formation, and can be used to test models of crater formation and modification in the future."

During the late fifth and early fourth centuries, the sympotic setting was inherently linked to the social conditions of that contentious period, at which point the symposium becomes a useful space for the articulation of larger tensions that pervaded the Athenian polis. The literary symposium proved to be a useful mode for presenting conflicting opinions about class, politics, and education-specifically during the early years of the Peloponnesian War. I examine Aristophanes' Wasps, the Symposium of Xenophon, and Plato's dialogue of the same name. These texts demonstrate the ways in which the sympotic setting was particularly well suited to discussions about education, while they also present a figuration of young elite men as heirs to inherited sets of principles and behaviors. Thus, the role of the symposium in education and the transmission of knowledge from father to son or from student to teacher become central themes in my research."

In this thesis, I explore the past and present of Quebec's nationalism to answer the questions of who supports and who opposes secession. Using a survey, I isolated factors that we can use to predict supporters and detractors of separatism in Quebec, including native language, age, contact with native speakers of French and English, language proficiency, positivity or negativity toward French and English, and political and/or social beliefs about language in Quebec. This information can shed greater light on the sovereignty movement and give us a better understanding of policies that could be put in place to change opinions on Quebec secession."

Oles, James","The sculptural practice of Adrián Villar Rojas (b. 1980, Argentina) threatens to fissure the continuous façade of our reality through its uncanny insinuation of parallel temporalities. His construction of monumental ruins amalgamates disparate forms ranging from the organic to the aggressively industrial, and his large-scale works are rendered more enigmatic due to their calculated destruction. His use of unfired clay produces a decaying aesthetic that alludes to the fragility of narratives traditionally imbued in monumental forms, thereby calling attention to the tenuous nature of memory and history. By producing works abroad that are intentionally oscillatory and endowing them with familial, and often morbid, titles (ie. My Dead Family; The Murder of Your Heritage; Before My Birth), the artist alludes to the pervasive ambiguities in Argentina's political atmosphere that perpetuate the elusive nature of its recent historical past. Regardless of his active participation within an international circuit of contemporary art, Villar Rojas' enigmatic and ruinous aesthetic remains driven by his latent historical inheritance."

This paper explores the relationships between civil war generals and their troops in Lucan's Bellum civile, an Imperial historical epic that deals with the wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey in the late 40s BCE, with the traditional Roman scorn for crowds in mind. Specifically, the paper looks at moments of potential mutiny against each major general in the poem and how Lucan uses these moments to characterize the moral qualities of each general, investigate the psyche of the common soldier, and deliberate on the meaning of civil war. The common soldiers have the power to change the tide of events if they stand together, but any crowd is also made up of individuals whom Lucan wishes would think for themselves and recognize the immorality of their behavior - an act that could undermine the commander for each individual but would make them lose their collective power. Ultimately, though there are four major potentially mutinous situations throughout the poem, Caesar's great mutiny against Roma - the civil war itself - is the only one that succeeds. Unlike many Classical historical texts, in Lucan's poem it is not the mob that is the enemy but the one man, and thus the poet can lament the fact that the common soldiers fail to use their power rather than fear the fact that they could."

As the most visible and influential politically-oriented youth organization to appear in Russia during this time period, Nashi was, for a time, a powerful symbol of patriotic youth activism and official state politics. Along with my historical discourse on Nashi and the pro-Kremlin youth movement, I identified a set of youth groups whose activities aimed to oppose or undermine the personal figure and politics of Putin, and correspondingly, Nashi. In doing so, I examined the divergence of political imperatives and competing interests between Nashi and the opposition youth movement that made youth politics specially contentious during the first decade of the twenty-first century."

Blake conceived the medium of the book as an ideal vehicle that, marrying text and image, had the power to join the author and the reading public. In addition to interpreting Blake's poems, I examine his books as material objects, paying special attention to the relation of text and image.

However, research suggests that single-sex education may still be beneficial to women in ways that co-education is not. Women's colleges encourage students to pursue non-traditional career paths, offer more female role models and mentoring opportunities, provide more leadership experiences on campus, and cultivate generally supportive campus environments in which students develop social and academic self-confidence. In this study, I examine the experiences of female students at two women's colleges and two co-educational colleges and find that women's college students differ from their peers as prospective students in that they are more likely to be seeking academically challenging environments. After arriving on campus, they are more likely to report positive social experiences and interactions with diversity during their first year, though this difference is eliminated in subsequent years. They are also more likely to hold leadership positions and somewhat more likely to switch to and persist in STEM fields. I suggest that women's colleges still offer real benefits to their students, and that co-educational colleges should look to them as effective models of how to support both male and female students on their campuses."

Hedgehog (Hh) is a major signaling pathway found in most, if not all, animal species, including humans. In vertebrates, Hh signaling has been shown to play key roles during limb regeneration. To determine whether Hedgehog might also play a role during limb regeneration in Tribolium castaneum, Hh signaling was silenced through RNA interference. In normal development, silencing of Hh signaling resulted in alteration of limb morphology. Disruption of Hh signaling during regeneration led to the impairment of blastema growth and subsequent adult limb morphogenesis during metamorphosis. Furthermore, cellular proliferation in the blastema diminished with the silencing of Hh. Our findings indicate that Hh signaling is necessary for regeneration in beetles similar to vertebrates and have broader implications for our understanding of the developmental and evolutionary origins of set-aside cells."

However, despite the similarity of their original offenses, each man is punished differently, and these plays reach startlingly different outcomes and fall into a different genre. Scholars have long wondered why. Examining the plays reveals important dissimilarities between these men, their partners, and their relationships, and as the plot and the characters unfold, the couples are driven towards diverse endings. Claudio, barely punished, gets a happy ending. Othello, though, is brutally punished. Finally, Posthumus, also roughly punished, learns how to redeem himself and save his marriage. By rewarding some actions and choices with happy endings and condemning others to sorrow and death, Shakespeare paints a picture about the importance of a certain kind of love and bond in a healthy and strong relationship."

This study compared the lexical retrieval ability of 30 English monolinguals, 25 early Spanish-English bilinguals (AOA birth to three years), and 17 late Spanish-English bilinguals (AOA four to nine years). Participants completed a picture-naming task in English, a measure of non-verbal intelligence (Cattell Culture Fair Test), and a standardized measure of vocabulary size (PPVT-III). We predicted that both bilingual groups would experience more lexical retrieval difficulty on the picture naming tasks relative to monolinguals but that early bilinguals would experience less difficulty than late bilinguals."

Rap music is a poetics and a politics in which construction of oppositional narratives and presentation and performances of race, gender, and sexuality is possible. The works of hip hop artists Azealia Banks, Frank Ocean, Las Krudas, and Big Freedia particularly illuminate the processes of identity formation and presentation. Using queerness to examine hip-hop, and using hip-hop to examine queerness demonstrates the significance of hip-hop as a cultural production and social movement."

Solidifying itself through anticlerical policy, the French state reified the notion of a Republic-Church opposition. The secularized school and its morale républicaine became instrumental in this process. An analysis of the textbooks which preached this morale républicaine, however, reveals the continuities between the latter and Christian principles. At the same time, an examination of the political debates surrounding school secularization suggests a reason for the obfuscation of such continuities. By unmasking these, I will introduce a more nuanced appreciation of la laïcité and the role of French anticlericalism in shaping conceptions of the Republic."
494,Etrusco-Corinthian Pottery in the Archaic West: An Evaluation of Fineware Exchange and Etruscan Agency,"Bertram, Haley",Classical Studies,2013,"Burns, Bryan","This thesis examines the role of fineware in overseas exchange through an analysis of Etrusco-Corinthian pottery in the Archaic western Mediterranean. By considering stylistic analysis more broadly, as well as the archaeological contexts of the ware, I evaluate the role of the pottery in the Western settlements of Massalia and Saint Blaise, and consider questions of the production and export of the ware. This approach highlights the problematic nature of conclusions drawn about the economic progression of Etrusco-Corinthian pottery as a declining ware. I argue that these conclusions stem from a previous conception of Etruscan inferiority to the Greeks, and that this stereotype has also extended to discussions of Etruscan agency in the West. I assert that Etruscans in the West are functioning within a cosmopolitan world of exchange, and that the Etruscans are visibly active in this market, as demonstrated through the continued demand and consumption of Etrusco-Corinthian sympotica by populations of the West. Based on the archaeological contexts, the consumers of imported wares appear to have been crucial in shaping this demand by actively seeking a varied collection of imported fineware. Questions remain regarding precisely how the production process of the ware relates to export. Despite this, the study of Etrusco-Corinthian pottery in the West clearly establishes the fineware as a commodity, both in Etruria and abroad, and also concludes that Etruscan wares circulated within the cosmopolitan Mediterranean network on a equal, not subordinate, level to Greek wares."
495,Personal Need for Structure: Indiscriminate Classification Systems As Barriers to Processing Mathematical Complexity,"Sarnataro-Smart, Sierra",Psychology,2013,"Hennessey, Beth A.","This study applied previous research findings on stereotyping and individual differences in the need for simple structure to an investigation of math anxiety. The same kind of indiscriminately broad categorical thinking that underpins social stereotyping was observed in math anxious students confronted with mathematical complexity. Study participants who scored high in the need for simple structure were significantly more likely to experience math anxiety and to have adopted the belief that math intelligence is fixed. In addition, this investigation revealed that participants' implicit assumptions about the origins of math intelligence covaried with math anxiety. The potential benefits of introducing the conceptual underpinnings of math problems in a simple, straightforward fashion prior to increasing task difficulty were explored through the presentation of two progressively challenging counting tasks. While math anxious participants did significantly worse than their non-anxious peers on the initial simpler task, as complexity increased, math anxious individuals' degree of success on the second, more challenging task paralleled that of their non-anxious peers. Taken together, these study findings inform our understanding of math anxious students' cognitive barriers to mathematical comprehension and fluency and suggest specific teaching strategies that might be employed to address these issues.

Martial's choices to not only publish his books for the general public but circulate these texts through booksellers lead to the characterization of Martial as one of the preeminent authors of innovative poetry in the Roman Empire. This thesis seeks to investigate, analyze, and discuss the relationships present in Martial's works between author and audience, text and its physical form, and poet and patron. In analyzing the complexities of Martial's poetry and his own approach to literature and relationships, modern readers can gain insight into the world of classical poetry and art as well as the social dynamics, political tensions, and inherent economic disparities of ancient Rome. This thesis seeks to answer how these relationships between author and audience, poetry and its physical form, and patron and poet intersect in Martial's epigrams and become integral to the transformative nature of his work."

The Changing Status of On Kawara's Conceptual Art Objects,"Borno, Aisha Lovise Ma",Art,2017,"Berman, Patricia","The creation of the conceptual work of art begins with the artist's idea and ends with its communication or implementation. Hereafter the idea can only be encountered insofar as its materialization acts as record, embodiment, or agent of the work. The life of the object has however just begun. As the materials leave the artist's ownership and enter the art world, they become artifacts, whose ascribed value and meaning shift as they enter different contexts. This thesis examines the complex and ambiguous relationship between a work's conceptual aims and its material presence through a trifold exploration of the oeuvre of Japanese artist On Kawara (1933-2014). Following the life of Kawara's conceptual art objects as they are realized in the studio, enter the market and exhibition, and transition to their afterlife in permanent museum collections, I consider how the changing status of the object shapes the meaning of the conceptual work."

I examine the contexts in which states report and make decisions to import toxic waste within both industrialized and developing countries.

Although most countries that do import toxic waste are industrialized, the developing countries that do import toxic waste are the most corrupt developing countries."

Webb, Andrew
Elmore, Donald","Although the behavior of nanomedicines is well characterized, understanding of the difference between the synthetic and biological identity of nanoparticles (NPs) is limited. To expand our knowledge base, we probe the stability of NPs and protein corona formation in increasingly in vivo-like conditions. The protein corona consists of various proteins at different relative abundances, rapidly forming when NPs are exposed to protein-rich environments. We begin our investigation through the synthesis and conjugation of 11.2 nm, citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Coating AuNPs with low fouling polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or poly-EK (PEK), increases the biocompatibility, biodistribution, and physiological half-life of AuNPs. We evaluate the protein corona formation in the presence of two types of polymer coatings: methoxy-terminated PEG (MPEG) and PEK. Using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Zeta-potential, we first monitor size, charge, and monodispersity to confirm functionalization. Second, incubating each AuNP model with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme under various conditions confirms that proteins adsorb to our models and that their adsorption changes the surface chemistry of the NPs. Finally, protein corona formation in complex media is evaluated by incubating the AuNPs models with increasingly concentrated pooled human serum. Through purification, digestion, and analysis via HPLC/MS-MS, UV-Vis, DLS, we determine the types and amount of protein that form the corona. In addition, by studying corona formation around MPEG- and PEK-conjugated maleimide polystyrene magnetic beads, we isolate the role that the gold nanoparticle and stealth coating may each play. The stability of the AuNPs in human serum is also analyzed through ICP-OES. This study aims to inform nanomedicine design and provide insight into biological identity of NPs."
503,Stumbling onto New Ideas: Technical Structure and Interactional Norms on Online Social Media,"Chmyz, Julia",Sociology,2017,"Rutherford, Markella","In its early stages, the Internet was viewed as an open forum for sharing and learning. Now, with a few dominant social media sites mediating most web access and the popular conception of these sites as polarizing filter bubbles, the promise of the open web appears to have been compromised. However, users of the microblogging website Tumblr do not experience this effect, instead encountering new ideas and topics alongside the content with which they intend to engage. Through a survey of over 250 Tumblr users, computational analysis of blogs, and interviews with users, my thesis seeks to uncover why Tumblr has become fertile ground for exposure to new content, expanding users' information networks rather than reinforcing their preconceptions. I identify the key technical features of the site and social norms that work in combination to create this effect. The technical affordances include Tumblr's disconnect from users' offline networks, the site's less socially focused user experience, reblogs and tags, and the customizability and control given to blog owners. The social understandings that have developed within these affordances include perceived anonymity, low-risk participation, and self-centered blogging. Within the limitations and allowances imposed by these technical constraints and social rules, many users curate personal blogs where they post a diversity of content that reflects their own interests and thoughts. Because of the unsorted nature of the Tumblr dashboard, users that follow personal blogs will encounter all of the content posted on those blogs, and in this way, be exposed to topics and ideas they were not looking for originally."

Joseph, William A.","In December 2015, supported by the Schiff fellowship, I traveled to Colombia to interview recently demobilized female FARC guerillas participating in state reintegration programs. Estimates suggest that 40% of the combatants in Colombia's decades-long conflict are women. However, the complex role that women have played has largely been overlooked. Much of the literature on conflict resolution assumes a dichotomy in which women are either 'victims' or 'perpetrators.' In reality, the distinction between these absolute categories is never entirely clear. The purpose of my trip was to examine women's particular experiences as combatants, looking at the circumstances that led them to join the FARC, the roles they played within the organization, and their transition back into mainstream society. My research reveals that there is no easy distinction between victims and perpetrators in the conflict, as the majority of female combatants describe an ambiguous experience in which coercion and consent, empowerment and abuse coexist in uneasy and tenuous relationships."
509,Reading Faulkner South of the South: The Latin American Boom's Roots and Legacy,"Rodríguez-Pliego, Mariajosé",English,2016,"Rosenwald, Lawrence A.","Latin American writers in the twentieth century were in search of a literary identity. Victoria Ocampo's Buenos Aires-based journal Sur translated literature from abroad and distributed it far into the corners of the region. Amongst these books were Faulkner's then-controversial novels and short stories, which made it to the hands of aspiring writers like Mario Vargas Llosa in Lima, Carlos Fuentes in Mexico City, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Cartagena. My thesis seeks to understand how each of these three writers read and appropriated Faulkner's techniques to portray the Latin American reality in the sixties. I explore topics such as the role that translation plays in the process of learning from a foreign writer, theories of influence, and the importance of narrative techniques."

Due to its seven transmembrane domains, a nuanced model of the GLP-1R structure cannot be elucidated through X-ray crystallography. We intend to improve current understanding of GLP-1R structure and binding mechanisms by chemically modifying T-0632, one of its non-peptide small molecule antagonists, in order to alter its interactions with the GLP-1R active site. To accomplish this, we will produce an analog of T-0632 in which an amine group is inserted at the standard carboxylic acid locus. In doing so, we will disrupt charged interactions between T-0632 and the extracellular loops of GLP-1R; these interactions are suspected of producing the inhibitory effect in bound T-0632."
516,ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GLOBAL FACTORS IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS,"Li, Mingfei",Economics,2017,,"Capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs) plunged during the global financial crisis (GFC) but surged afterwards. Both country-specific factors and global factors, which are outside the source and host countries, have affected investment decisions around the world. My thesis focuses on a comparison of the significance of country-specific and global factors in explaining portfolio investment from advanced economies (AEs) to EMEs before and after the GFC, so as to shed light on the drivers of capital inflows to EMEs. I employ a gravity-model with data from 2001-07 and 2010-14 for 20 AEs and 20 EMEs. The results suggest that VIX, a measure of global volatility, gained a higher significance in affecting portfolio debt investment from AEs to EMEs after the GFC."
517,Banking Crises at the Micro-Level: the Panic of 1837,"Liang, Katharine",Economics,2017,"Hilt, Eric","In the substantial body of literature that has been written about the Panic of 1837, two schools of thought have become dominant. One focuses on domestic factors such as Andrew Jackson's Specie Circular and legislation to distribute the federal surplus, while the other focuses on an international shock stemming from changes in the Bank of England's lending policies. Although there is compelling evidence supporting each of the theories, the Panic remains imperfectly understood. This paper uses new bank-level data to econometrically test each of the existing theories and to explore an additional trigger. I find that the effects of the distribution to be overemphasized and that while some evidence supports the theory focused on international factors, the data strongly suggests that the Panic was in fact due to the collapse of confidence in Andrew Jackson's pet banking system."

Van Vliet, Krystyn J.","Oligodendrocytes are specialized glial cells that insulate neuron axons in the central nervous system with a vital proteolipid sheath called myelin. Oligodendrocytes in the adult brain are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes can be observed in vitro; however, this process is incomplete as myelin wrapping cannot be observed when there are no physical structures in culture with which developing OPCs can interact. The development of artificial axon surrogates aims to address this problem by developing geometric and mechanical mimics of axons from materials. The work presented here describes the development of a new axon surrogate that incorporates electrical activity into the in vitro platform. Axon surrogates were developed as conductive polymer nanofibers composed of a polyaniline composite, PANI/PG. PANI/PG nanofiber mats fabricated by electrospinning demonstrate unique and dynamic electrical properties that change over the course of the OPC culture. These changes provide evidence that conductive fiber substrata in the future might be used as an indirect method for measuring cell behavior on the mats. Moreover, this myelination detection method could be adjusted for quick and high-throughput readouts, providing an efficient new platform for the drug discovery of remyelination therapies. In addition, when an electrical potential was applied to PANI/PG fiber mats during OPC differentiation, cells showed an upregulation of differentiation and myelination transcripts Hdac11, Cnp, and Mbp 2-4-fold compared to OPCs which did not receive electrical stimulation. These data suggest that developing OPCs are strongly influenced by electric fields."
521,More Than Growth: The Shift from Performance Legitimacy to Moral Legitimacy in Structural Adjustment and Poverty Reduction,"Mallary, Katharine",Political Science,2017,"Murphy, Craig","The failure of Structural Adjustment Policies to produce growth in sub-Saharan Africa led to a regional dearth of trust in International Financial Institutions (IFIs) following the 1980s. However, the World Bank and the IMF have remained active in this region, continuing their work in local economies as well as beginning new poverty alleviation projects. In this study, I examine whether the shift to the poverty alleviation agenda has reinforced the legitimacy of IFIs in regions affected by structural adjustment. In particular, I'm concerned with whether these institutions were able to retain their legitimacy by shifting the grounds on which they placed their legitimacy from their performance (GDP growth) to their normative value (poverty alleviation). To do this, I draw on existing frameworks for considering legitimacy. These include J. Michael Williams' framework for examining political legitimacy, which divides legitimacy into moral legitimacy and performance legitimacy, and Jens Steffek's discourse approach to the legitimation of international governance. I find that Poverty Reduction Strategy papers do not represent a substantive shift from the economics structural adjustment, but rather, justify familiar theories with new methods of legitimation."

The endosomal recycling pathway that establishes and maintains proper PIN1 localization is coordinated by phosphoinositide species within the cell's membranes. In order to determine if the Sec14-like proteins PATELLIN1/2 and the related PATLELLIN6 are involved in regulating these phosphoinositide pools during vascular development, PATELLIN1/2 and other known vascular genes in this pathway or PATELLIN6 were knocked out and analyzed for evidence of genetic interactions. Analysis of the cotyledon venation of these higher order mutants revealed PATLELLIN1/2 interact with CVL1 and CVP2, but only weakly with VAB. Additionally, evidence showed PATELLIN6 plays a role in vascular development, but is not redundant with PATELLIN1/2. Therefore, this study provides evidence that PATELLIN1/2 play a role in regulating the PtdIns(4,5)P2 pools that are necessary for PIN1 endocytosis, while PATELLIN6 plays a unique role during vascular development."
524,"Glutamate Transporters in Caenorhabditis Elegans: the Implications of Transporter Deletions on Behavior, Learning, Memory, and Addiction","Harling, Moriah",Neuroscience,2017,"Bauer, Deborah","Glutamate is a critical neurotransmitter involved in excitatory synaptic transmission, cognition, memory, and learning. Although much research has been conducted to examine glutamatergic signaling pathways, the functional role of glutamate transporters (GLTs) in behavior, learning, and memory remains largely unexplored in Caenorhabditis elegans. We tested wildtype C. elegans and C. elegans with GLT deletions on a battery of behavioral tests including analysis of spontaneous locomotion, response to a mechanosensory stimulus, response to an aversive chemical, and chemotaxis in response to a chemoattractant and a chemorepellent to examine how different transporters affect basic behaviors. Thus far, we have examined C. elegans with deletions of GLT-3 located in canal cells, GLT-1 located in muscle cells, GLT-4 located on presynaptic neurons, and GLT-5 located within the pharyngeal region. We then conducted associative and non-associative learning paradigms. Compared to wildtypes, GLT-3; GLT-1 knockouts were deficient in all basic behavioral tasks besides chemotaxis in response to a chemorepellent, GLT-4 knockouts were deficient in all basic behavioral tasks besides response to the smell of an aversive chemical, and GLT-5 knockouts were deficient in response to the smell of an aversive chemical and chemotaxis in response to a chemoattractant, however they exhibited a hyperactive chemotactic response to a chemorepellent. All mutants displayed associative learning, however GLT-4 and GLT-5 mutants had less of an extreme response to the aversive chemical prior to conditioning and expressed less association to that same chemical in the post-learning period. Mutants with GLT-3; GLT-1 or GLT-5 deletions do not display normal habituation, a type of non-associative learning, while GLT-4 mutants were not analyzed in this paradigm due to an abnormal initial response. We next examined exposure to the addictive substances nicotine and ethanol as a type of memory. We evaluated the ability for different mutant strains to express drug-seeking behavior and initial preference for these drugs. We then tested whether the mutants would associate the drugs with an aversive chemical as we demonstrated in wildtypes. Compared to wildtypes, all mutant strains expressed decreased chemoattraction toward ethanol but unaltered chemoattraction toward nicotine. Furthermore, all mutants exhibited associative learning after ethanol or nicotine conditioning but expressed less association in the post-learning period than the wildtype strain. Our data suggest that basic behaviors may rely on different glutamate transporters than learning and memory do. These differences may be attributable to differences in transporter localization."

This thesis places Millennials at the intersection of modernity and generational theories by analyzing the generational identity and coming of age processes of modern young adults in conjunction with the anxieties, insecurities, and existential concerns that accompany their transition into adulthood. Data was collected in Northern California using in-depth interviews with 25 young adults between the ages of 17 and 27. Despite being members of the same generation, their experiences are not easily generalizable due to the increasing importance of identity factors such as race, gender, and social class. Their present life stage - existing between adolescence and adulthood - and upbringing within the fluid context of modernity have led to anxieties, concerns, and fears regarding the uncertainty of their future. These concerns are exacerbated by the constant presence of social media, which leads to comparison and fosters insecurity, competition, and envy. To cope with the anxiety and insecurity of this life stage, many Millennials participate in modern therapeutic culture by prioritizing and openly discussing their emotions. Furthermore, parents play a key role by creating a ""safety net"" that Millennials believe they can fall into, thereby assuaging some of the fear of failure. Millennials are distinctly modern: they engage in reflexivity, understand their identity both subjectively and socially, and prioritize individualism and diversity."

The Rubin Causal framework was used to draw causal inferences instead of just correlation. Doing so, it is possible to attribute any effect to the type of First Year Mentor or First Year advisor assigned to the student. In the mentoring component, the data was analyzed using Fisher's Test and the Separate Regressions Method. Each method gave some statistically significant results; however they were not practically significant due to their small effect sizes. Our approach to the mentoring component of this study illustrates a novel application of rerandomization techniques to a natural experiment. In the advising component, the data was analyzed using subclassification because the assignment of advisors is not randomized. After subclassification, the data was analyzed using a weighted t-test. The results were not statistically significant. Thus, First Mentors and First Year Advisors do not appear to have an effect on a Wellesley student's choice of major."
531,Seize the Window: Targeted Killing's Uses and Limitations in Counterterrorism Strategy,"Kutner, Jillian","International Relations
Political Science",2017,"Hajj, Nadya","Since the beginning of the War on Terror in 2001, the United States has employed a plethora of methods to destroy terrorist organizations, ranging from conventional war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, to espionage and, more recently, cyber warfare. However, with the advent of drones, the United States has increasingly relied on one particular strategic tool for fighting global terror: targeted killing. Namely the assassination of a leader or key member of a terrorist group to disrupt or destroy the organization. Though the effectiveness of targeting has improved in recent years, strategic options regarding how to capitalize on instances of success have not. My research attempts to fill this policy void by asking two central research questions. First, does targeted killing reduce the rate of terrorist attacks post targeted killing? Second, what can be done to further reduce terrorist attacks post targeted killing? To evaluate these questions, I use a multi-method analysis combining a quantitative analysis of the frequency of terrorist attacks, as well as a qualitative, comparative analysis of a variety of case studies on targeted killings from numerous terrorist groups and geographic areas. Using the examples of Osama Bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and Saleh Shehadeh, I argue that, while targeted killing is ineffective in terms of destroying or permanently debilitating terrorist organizations, this strategy does manage to create a six-month reduction in attacks. Even so, targeted killing will not reach its greatest potential until policy makers stop simply moving to the next target, and instead find a way to better capitalize on the benefits it can provide."
532,"El Significado de Salud: Social Determinants of Health, Public Policy, and Mexican-born Women in Chicago","Saladi, Nikita",Women's and Gender Studies,2016,"Galarneau, Charlene","According to the World Health Organization, social determinants of health are the ""conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life."" To attain better health outcomes, such determinants and the public policies that shape them must be considered. In my research, I attempt to answer two questions: how do social determinants of health such as socioeconomic status, place, and access to health care affect the health of Mexican-born women in Chicago? Furthermore, how do public policies shape such determinants and the health of these women? In exploring these questions, I draw upon relevant existing literature and my interviews with nine Mexican-born women in Chicago. These sources illustrate the unique constellation of social determinants of health that affect these women and could inform more effective public policies."
533,Memory for Imagined Relationships and the Connection between Fantasy Orientation and Social Ability,"Bennett Pierre, Grace",Psychology,2016,"Gleason, Tracy","Creating imaginary companions (ICs) is a common occurrence in early childhood. However, how often ICs are remembered beyond early childhood and what factors might influence that memory is an open question. Similarly, although having an IC in early childhood is associated with greater social ability; whether fantasy orientation is related to social ability later in life is unknown. I interviewed adolescents who participated in a study about ICs when they were preschoolers about their memories of those ICs. I predicted that the age at which a child created an IC, the duration of that IC, family support of the companion and the presence of a notable event related to the IC would influence whether adolescents remembered having an IC. I hypothesized that family support of an IC could be a proxy for family support of fantasy and that support of fantasy would be positively associated with fantasy orientation in adolescence. I also hypothesized that current fantasy orientation would be positively associated with Theory of Mind ability. About half of the adolescents interviewed remembered their childhood IC. Duration was positively associated with memory for ICs, while family support of an IC was marginally associated with memory. Neither family support nor having a notable event related to an IC was associated with adolescent fantasy orientation. Fantasy orientation and Theory of Mind ability were not correlated. The findings of this study suggest that many people do not remember their ICs from early childhood, but that longer duration and familial rehearsal may support recollection. In addition, the connection between fantasy and imaginative play and social ability seen in early childhood does not appear to persist into adolescence."
534,Syntheses of Methylisoquinoline Derivatives for Incorporation into Photolabile Aryl Azide T-0632 Analogs to Explore the GLP-1R Active Site,"Bancroft, Laura",Chemistry,2017,"Haines, David R.","Type II diabetes is a disease that begins as insulin resistance in the tissues of the body and over time, the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreas become so stressed that they cannot adequately produce insulin. Decreased β cell functionality leads to states of hyperglycemia where blood glucose levels are dangerously high, leading to complications such as heart attack and stroke. In order to develop treatments for this disease, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been identified as a medicinal target. Studies of the binding of GLP-1R have taken many directions, including X-ray crystallography and computational modeling. Also, peptide-based treatments for type II diabetes have been proposed and are in use. However, small molecules can aid both fronts as treatments for type II diabetes and probes for small molecule active site exploration in GLP-1R. One particular small molecule that interacts with GLP-1R is T-0632. This molecule was originally developed for interacting with the cholecystokinin receptor, but it also binds well to GLP-1R. Although an antagonist to GLP-1R, T-0632 can be used to study the small molecule binding site of GLP-1R to give insight into what small molecule structures could activate the receptor. Our research focuses on synthesizing photolabile T-0632 derivatives to map the small molecule active site of GLP-1R with the help of our collaborators at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, AZ."
535,Learning to Learn: Military Learning in Disaster Relief Operations,"Bechtel, Caroline",Political Science,2017,"MacDonald, Paul K.
Hajj, Nadya","How does the military learn in disaster relief operations? The American military has long played a critical role in international responses to natural disasters. Its forward-deployed resources, manpower, and other unique capabilities make it a critical asset for the larger disaster relief community. While the U.S. military and scholars alike have poured considerable resources into understanding how the military learns in traditional operations, this literature fails to provide a compelling explanation for how and why the military learns in non-combat operations. Interviews with involved officials and primary source evidence of learning suggests that the military is better at learning in these operations than the current literature would predict. This project relies heavily on interviews with military and civilian personnel, military after action reviews, and authoritative secondary sources. The current literature on military learning predicts low levels of learning to occur in non-combat operations. Nevertheless, the U.S. military in the Asia Pacific has consistently learned from disaster relief operations and has, in fact, significantly improved its formal and informal processes of learning during these operations. To put it simply, the military has actively improved its capacity to learn how to learn. This finding upends the current literature on military learning and calls for a reevaluation of the potential value of non-combat operations in the future."

Park, Kyung","In response to publicized shootings of minority civilians, several police agencies across the county have announced that they will hire more minority police officers. However, there is a dearth of quantitative research examining real-life consequences of police diversity. Between 1969 and 2000, a number of police departments were sued for racial and gender discrimination, and many responded by putting into place affirmative action policies. We use affirmative action litigation status of police departments to proxy for increases in workforce diversity, relying on evidence from previous studies with access to confidential demographic information on police workforces. Using litigation information on 479 of the largest state and local U.S. police departments and hospital data from counties across the U.S., we estimate the effect of affirmative action litigation on various measures of crime and deaths. We introduce a method to measure affirmative action litigation exposure at the county level, as our outcome variables are at the county level while our legal data is at the agency level. Our analysis relies on the assumption that all counties in our sample would have been on the same trend if they had the same exposure to litigated policing. We find that increases in exposure to affirmative action litigation led to a decrease in the probability that there would be a death due to police interaction for all persons, and this effect was driven by deaths among nonwhites. We also find a decrease in arrests after affirmative action litigation for all persons."
539,The Effect of Iconicity Type on Preschool Children's Gesture Learning: A Role for Embodiment?,"Chen, Jenny",Psychology,2016,"Pyers, Jennie","Iconicity, or the similarity between a symbol and its meaning, is found in many languages, especially in sign languages. Children use iconicity to facilitate new word learning, although the age when they seem to reliably leverage iconicity varies from study to study. Previous studies have inconsistently classified iconic gesture type, and this inconsistency may have affected their findings and generalizability. We proposed that children might be differently sensitive to iconic gestures with varying degrees of embodiment. Therefore, we categorized iconic gesture types based on level of embodiment, with gestures differing in terms of action and/or perceptual features. We tested adults (n = 20) and children (n = 81) on their baseline recognition of iconic and non-iconic gestures that represented familiar objects. Then, we taught the same participants three different types of iconic and non-iconic gestures to determine which gesture types were more easily learned. Results indicated that adults were at ceiling in recognizing and learning all iconic gesture types. Four- to five-year-old children were less accurate than adults, but learned all iconic gesture types equally well. Three-year-old children recognized and learned iconic gestures that had higher levels of action-based embodiment than gestures that represented perceptual features. Therefore, children attend to different features of iconicity throughout development, suggesting that embodiment does play a role in children's ability to learn gestures."
540,Tutor-Complete: An Educational Game and Intelligent Tutoring System for Languages and Automata,"Kjeer, Katherine",Computer Science,2016,"Mustafaraj, Eni","Educational games and Intelligent Tutoring Systems have been shown to improve student learning outcomes by increasing engagement and providing individualized instruction. However, while introductory programming students frequently benefit from such systems, students in upper-level theoretical courses such as CS 235 (Languages and Automata) have dense textbooks and dry mathematical readings as their primary or only resources. Tutor-Complete aims to fill this gap by presenting two fundamental CS 235 concepts in a game environment. In the first activity, students construct Deterministic Finite-State Automata in order to guide their character across a landscape. In the second activity, students build proofs using the pumping lemma to defeat the ""villain"" character. Tutor-Complete also fosters a peer-learning environment by encouraging students to explain concepts to each other and providing hints based on past student work. Finally, Tutor-Complete uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing to model students' knowledge and tailor the learning experience accordingly."
541,"Shyness, Love-Shyness, and Individual Differences in Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors","Randall, Alyson",Psychology,2016,"Cheek, Jonathan M.","The term ""love-shyness"" was coined by Gilmartin in 1987 to separate sexual issues from other intrapsychic and interpersonal issues involved in the psychology of shyness. Based on his interpretation of American gender roles, Gilmartin (1987) believed that love-shyness was predominantly a male phenomenon. However, his argument that love-shyness does not affect women lacked empirical support (Cheek, 1989). Therefore, the purpose of the present research was to investigate the relationship between shyness and sexuality in two samples of college women obtained in 2012 and 2015 (total N = 268). Shyness was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of sexual quantity, such as total number of lifetime partners, in both the 2012 and 2015 samples. In addition, shyness was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of sexual quality, such as frequency of orgasm with a partner, in both samples. These results indicate that Gilmartin's conclusion that love-shyness is only a significant problem among men was premature."
542,Optimizing the apFRET technique to investigate the interaction of the cardiac potassium channels hERG and KvLQT1,"Wade, Heidi",Biological Chemistry,2016,,"hERG and KvLQT1 are voltage-gated potassium channel protein α-subunits encoded for by KCNH2 and KCNQ1, respectively, that play a critical role in regulating the human heartbeat. hERG and KvLQT1 respectively produce the rapidly activating (I_62Kr) and slowly activating (I_Ks=) components of the cardiac repolarization current, which plays a critical role in regulating the action potential duration in cardiomyocytes. Both hERG and KvLQT1 channels have been shown to associate with the β-subunit, minK. While the expression of minK is not necessary for the production of I_Kr=, the association of minK with KvLQT1 is essential for the full production of I_Ks. Previously performed biochemical assays and acceptor photobleach FRET (apFRET) experiments indicate that hERG and KvLQT1 physically interact via their -C termini. The Darling lab has characterized the interaction of hERG and KvLQT1 via apFRET experiments and found there to be a positive FRET efficiency for the hERG-CFP + KvLQT1-YFP pair. This thesis aimed to investigate whether interchanging the fluorophores attached to hERG and KvLQT1 affects the FRET efficiency. In addition, this work addresses whether the concatenation of minK to KvLQT1, so the construct can produce full I_Ks current, alters the interaction between KvLQT1 and hERG, as measured via apFRET. In order to address these questions, apFRET experiments were performed on KvLQT1-CFP + hERG-YFP and hERG-CFP + minK-KvLQT1-mYFP FRET pairs. It was found that the mean FRET efficiencies of KvLQT1-CFP-YFP (positive control, n=24), hERG-CFP (negative control, n=30), hERG-CFP + KvLQT1-YFP (experimental control, n=24) were 27.6% ± 7.2%, -0.7% ± 6.6%, and 0.3% ± 5.6% respectively. The mean FRET efficiencies for the KvLQT1-CFP + hERG-YFP (n=15) and hERG-CFP + minK-KvLQT1-YFP pairs were -0.1% ± 4.9% and -2.2% ± 6.1% (n=20) respectively. The observed FRET efficiency close to 0% for the experimental control, hERG-CFP + KvLQT1-YFP, is an unexpected result based on previously published and ongoing work in the Darling lab. Thus, these data suggest that the apFRET technique needs further optimization before evaluating the FRET efficiencies of the KvLQT1-CFP + hERG-YFP and hERG-CFP + minK-KvLQT1-YFP FRET pairs."

Giersch, C. Pat","The business history of Communist China (1949-1978) is an important subject of study that gets little attention from scholars. To outside observers, three decades of rigid state planning and socialist ideological orthodoxy were immediately followed by the market reform of 1978 and miraculous economic development, suggesting a clear discontinuity in the Chinese economic history. My research examines the emergence of business structures and strategies at the enterprise level aimed at overcoming some of the challenges that China faced as a developing socialist country and comes to the conclusion that the post-1978 market reforms were foreshadowed by the country's previous experiences. It begins with the development of small, self-sufficient enterprises during the Great Leap Forward, often associated with the so-called ""backyard steel furnace"" movement and the shift in the 1960s to new forms of business enterprises geared toward both promoting specialization and facilitation integration. It argues that the market reforms in 1978 were direct outgrowths of a series of efforts to tackle the challenges of coordination that went all the way back to the Great Leap Forward. My research identifies important economic continuities that unfolded in Chinese business history on the enterprise level and urges a reconsideration of the origins of market reforms."
544,Iodination of the isoquinoline moiety of T-0632 to generate photolabile analogs,"Yang, Erin",Chemistry,2016,,"Glugacon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor located on the β-cells of the pancreas. When the incretin hormone, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), binds to GLP-1R, it triggers intracellular signaling cascades that lead to insulin release from pancreatic β-cells. However, the half-life of GLP-1 in plasma is less than two minutes, which makes GLP-1 ineffective to administer as a drug for treatment of abnormal glucose levels. Previous studies have investigated GLP-1R agonists for use of glucose-lowering therapy. T-0632, a non-peptidic small molecule, is an inverse agonist of GLP-1R. Understanding the molecular interactions of binding between T-0632 and GLP-1R within the binding pocket can provide deeper insights to drug design for diabetes treatment. In order to achieve this, we want to create a library of T-0632 analogs possessing an azido group in a variety of locations around the molecule. Azido-analogs of T-0632, prepared through iodine displacement, will allow photolabeling studies of these interactions. We have focused on generating azide substitutions on the isoquinoline moiety of T-0632. Iodination of a tetrahydroisoquinoline has given three of four possible iodinated products, as confirmed by initial mass spectrometry results. Oxidation of this isoquinoline results in the isoquinoline precursor to the iodinated T-0632."

In this thesis I shall sketch a contextualist suppositional account of conditional credence by drawing insights from two seemingly disjoint debates: the foundational debate on the relationship between conditional and unconditional probabilities, and the semantic debate on the relationship between conditional probability and probabilities of conditionals. I argue that, for a given pair of propositions A and B, the conditional credence one ought to have for B given that A - P(B|A) - may depend on contextual parameters like the way in which we mentally represent the extensions of as well as the stochastic relationships between A and B."

Butcher, Kristin F.","In response to increasing income inequality, many private educational institutions have adapted new approaches to financial aid, tuition, and campus investment. Implications of this changing strategy include the rise of an 'educational arms race'-in which institutions compete to enroll the best (and, at times, wealthiest) students by funding non-academic services (e.g. luxury dorms)-and the risk of relying on such policies to establish socioeconomic diversity. My analysis examines the consequences and implications of rising income inequality on higher education finances and supply-side decisions. In particular, I assess the changes instituted by private, non-parochial high schools, which have policies that closely resemble those of their post-secondary counterparts, when faced with varying levels of local inequality. Using data from the National Association of Independent Schools, and standard methods for addressing pooled, cross-sectional, time series data, I find that income inequality does not have significant effects on financial aid policies or tuition. However, rising inequality does appear to significantly increase the value of endowments (and assumed endowment spending) in these schools."
548,A Cognitive Computational Approach to Understanding Theory of Mind and Its Impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Rosenthal, Isabelle",Neuroscience,2016,"Conway, Bevil
Stanley, Damian
Adolphs, Ralph","Theory of Mind (ToM), the mental ability to represent other people's beliefs and intentions, remains a faculty that is poorly understood on a computational level. While a ""mentalizing network"" of implicated brain structures exists, the interaction of these structures and their specific functions still requires further study. Furthermore, although it is known that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to exhibit impairments in ToM, the nature of these impairments is not known. In this thesis, ToM is investigated through a novel learning task which bears a similar structure to past ToM tasks, but requires participants to update their representations of another individual's beliefs and intentions continuously over time. Participant behavior on this task was investigated using eight different computational models. Neurotypical individuals were able to complete the task, answering questions about beliefs and intentions with an accuracy significantly above chance. Although individuals with ASD had an accuracy on belief questions that was not significantly different from the control group, they were impaired in answering questions about intent. Similarly, a computational model based on the Rescorla-Wagner update rule was found that fit well to the control group, but this model fit much differently to the ASD population, and failed to perform as well in predicting ASD behavior. No model was found that predicted ASD behavior better than control behavior. This suggests heterogeneity in the way individuals with ASD compute ToM. While expanding current knowledge about the way neurotypical individuals generate ToM representations, these computational modeling results also provide an opportunity to better understand the neural underpinnings of these representations via neuroimaging."

McEwan, Patrick
McKnight, Robin","Reducing the rate of anemia is a primary public health concern in many developing countries, where more than half of school-aged children suffer from the many serious consequences of childhood anemia. India has some of the highest rates of iron-deficiency anemia in the world and in 2013 implemented the national school-based Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation Program (IFASP) with the goal of reducing the prevalence and severity of anemia among school children. Although many highly controlled efficacy trials document the ability of iron supplementation to improve iron levels, there is little evidence about the best methods for providing supplements to large populations. This paper examines the tablet distribution patterns of the IFASP and its effects on children's iron levels. I use implementation data for 378 schools in five administrative blocks of Keonjhar District, Odisha to provide descriptive analysis of program implementation patterns and find that although the more advantaged blocks had the most universal tablet distribution, tablets were quasi-randomly distributed to schools within the less advantaged blocks. This variation in tablet receipt provides the framework to estimate the causal effect of the policy using a difference-in-differences strategy. My primary empirical finding is that the IFASP raised hemoglobin levels by 0.3 g/dL overall and had the largest effect on mildly anemic students and students who had received tablets most recently. This suggests that, though effective, school-based supplementation may not be sufficient to address high rates of more severe anemia and may be limited by non-optimal distribution and the constraints of a school calendar."

We characterize the equilibrium in a market without endogeneity and study how the introduction of across-contract endogeneity into the model distorts the optimal contracts. The across-contract endogeneity can be viewed as a second source of endogeneity, in addition to moral hazard, that further reduces insurance coverage if the insurer considers its implication when choosing contracts. We show that a monopolist internalizes the externality exerted by the contracts and offers contracts with less coverage, which induce a lower level of average risk. Competitive insurers fail to account for the interdependence of risks and do not adjust accordingly. They offer excessive insurance, which leads to a higher level of average risk and creates inefficiency. Our analysis suggests that there is a trade-off between monopoly and perfect competition."

The first property we define is an ideal-theoretic generalization of the element-wise defined property ""nil clean,"" the condition that an element of a ring is the sum of a nilpotent and an idempotent. We establish a few characterizations for certain families of rings with this property, called ideally nil clean. In particular, a commutative ring is ideally nil clean if and only if it is strongly pi-regular. We show that the class of ideally nil clean rings also includes artinian rings, and von Neumann regular rings. Among other results, we demonstrate that ideally nil clean rings behave well under some ring extensions such as direct products and matrix rings. We also expand this generalization to the ideally nil clean property for one-sided ideals, and discuss the interaction between these different generalizations. We explore the interplay between nil clean rings and ideally nil clean rings."

Thus, what became of these former colonial African cities that were designed to promote European superiority? How did African leaders and urban planners overcome the challenges inherited from colonialism? Finally, how did the ideologies of African postcolonial leaders influence urban plans?

The present research examines the influence of cultural values on stigmatizing attitudes of individuals from different ethno-cultural groups, and further examines how these values may be passed on to future generations. Study 1 examined the endorsement of three kinds of stigma (public stigma, onset responsibility, and courtesy stigma) in three ethnic-cultural groups in the United States (South Asians, East Asians and European Americans), and tested the associations of these stigmas with cultural mechanisms (collectivism/individualism; interdependent/independent self-construals). Contrary to predictions, the three ethnic-cultural groups did not differ in their endorsement of public stigma and onset responsibility, however, South Asians were significantly more likely to endorse courtesy stigma than European Americans. Collectivist values were associated with higher stigmatizing attitudes, whereas interdependent self-construals were associated with lower stigma Study 2 examined how differences in endorsement of stigma between South Asian American and European American parents may influence the socialization of stigmatizing attitudes in children. Parents' explanations of mental illness to their children were compared across ethnic-cultural groups and across ages of participants' children. Categories of explanations used by parents to explain mental illness to children did not vary across ethnic-cultural groups. However, across cultural groups, parents were more likely to encourage older children to maintain relationships with individuals with mental illness.

A Content Analysis of Gender-Specific Speech Features in Song Lyrics,"Gallee, Jeanne",Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,2016,"Levitt, Andrea","Do gender-specific conversational speech patterns appear in the lyrics of male and female artists? To answer this question, chapter 1 first reviews sociolinguistic methods and describes evidence for gender-specific speech characteristics as well as for some of the differences in power dynamics between men and women that the use of these characteristics reveals. It then discusses the similarity of lyrics and speech, reviews some of the current literature on the effects of music on behavior, and provides a motivation for the study that is described in chapter 2. This study looks at the lyrics of 179 romantic songs sung by male and female artists from three genres (country, pop, and rock) across three time periods (1958-1960, 1985-1987, and 2012-2014). As is done in content-analysis studies, each song was evaluated for its number of words, filler words, self-referential pronouns (""I"" and ""me""), inclusive pronouns (""you and I"" and ""we""), terms of endearment, love references, and sexual references. Narrative coding techniques were used to evaluate songs for evidence of speaker confidence or agency, and for requests. Results demonstrated primarily several significant changes over time, but few significant differences due to gender. It may be necessary to have face-to-face interactions in order for these gender-specific speech characteristics to emerge and the songs do not provide such a context. Alternatively, it may be that the lyrics of successful songs by female artists are not representative of everyday women's speech."

During the task participants viewed brief movies of faces morphing from a neutral to a 100% prototypical emotional facial expression and were asked to stop the movie when they detected the face emotion. Participants in the frustration condition and participants with high trait irritability were expected to require greater emotional intensity in a facial expression in order to identify non-angry emotions and less intensity in order to identify anger. Results indicated that, although the frustration manipulation was successful, participants in the frustration and non-frustration conditions identified emotions at equal intensities. Participants in the frustration condition also identified happiness - the most easily identifiable emotion, and anger at comparable intensities. Trait irritability was unrelated to overall emotion intensity but correlated with hostile attribution biases. These findings suggest that the study of irritability and emotion identification should distinguish between state and trait irritability."
571,Boxed Out: Evaluating the Efficacy of Ban the Box Legislation,"Wickett, Amy",Economics,2016,"Levine, Phil
McKnight, Robin
Park, Kyung","Many states have recently instituted Ban the Box (BTB) policies, which are aimed at reducing post-incarceration employment barriers for ex-offenders by prohibiting employers from inquiring about criminal backgrounds on initial job applications. My analysis investigates the impact of BTB legislation by looking at state government employment outcomes resulting from the introduction of BTB provisions for state government hiring. I utilize a triple difference estimation strategy and data from the American Community Survey to evaluate the impact of BTB implementation. I look for changes in state employment in those states implementing BTB laws after the laws went into effect. Moreover, because of the high rates of criminality amongst the African-American high school dropout population, we would also expect BTB to have a larger relative impact on black dropouts than white dropouts. My findings suggest that in states with BTB legislation, state employment fell by 0.83 percentage points for black dropouts relative to white dropouts in those states implementing these laws after they went into effect. This is the opposite of what the policy's proponents anticipated. These results come with the caveat that the impact of the law change does not line up perfectly with the introduction of the law; however, this may be symptomatic of large decreases in government hiring due to the recession, which coincides with the implementation of BTB. I conclude that BTB may be ineffective at increasing ex-offender employment outcomes and may even be reducing employment levels for low-skilled African Americans without criminal records, consistent with statistical discrimination."

580,A Decade Later: An Evaluation of the Longer-Term Impacts of a Honduran Conditional Cash Transfer,"Rackstraw, Emma","Economics
International Relations",2014,"McEwan, Patrick","The simplicity of giving money to the poor for a specific and pre-approved purpose appeals to many stakeholders in the field of development- particularly policymakers and economists. In education policy, conditional cash transfers have been effective in improving school attendance and enrollment, as well as lowering child labor supply. However, the effects of CCTs have only been studied after a relatively short period of time after the transfer. The ultimate goal of investment in education is to get a return on that investment through an improvement in children's long-term wellbeing. This thesis captures these effects on long-term educational and labor supply outcomes up to a decade after the end of Honduras's CCT, PRAF. For the older education transfer recipients, the results include a 0.2-year increase in total schooling, a 2.7-percentage point increase in school attendance, and a 3.1-percentage point increase in literacy rates. The treatment effect on overall schooling increased over time, demonstrating that PRAF's impacts were not only sustained after the transfer, but that they actually grew over time. These effects were strongest for the poorest students, reaching over a full year of additional schooling between 2007 and 2009. Robustness checks support these results and a cost-benefit analysis suggests a high rate of return on the Honduran government's investment. These results not only answer questions about the effectiveness of PRAF in the context of Honduras, but also begin to fill a substantial void in the literature on long-term poverty alleviation strategies."
581,Authenticity in Adolescents and Young Adults' Relationships: The Roles of Emotion Regulation and Perceived Parental Feedback,"Abel, Madelaine",Psychology,2014,"Theran, Sally","The current study examined factors that influenced levels of authenticity in relationships with parents and levels of general authenticity. The study explored the associations among perceived parental feedback (support and criticism), emotion regulation (suppression and reappraisal), and authenticity in relationships. An additional goal was to determine if perceived support from parents moderated the relation between suppression and authenticity in relationships. A sample of female college students (N = 124, M age = 19.62 years) and a sample of female high school students (N = 31, M age = 15.87 years) completed self-report questionnaires related to perceptions of parent support and criticism, emotion regulation techniques, and authenticity in relationships. Results indicated that high levels of perceived criticism were associated with low levels of authenticity while high levels of perceived support were associated with high levels of authenticity. Further, suppression was related to lower levels of authenticity. These results were consistent for both samples. Finally, while reappraisal was not associated with higher levels of authenticity with parents, it was associated with higher levels of general authenticity. Results from the moderation analyses indicated that, with the high school sample, support from mothers moderated the relation between suppression and authenticity in relationships with mothers. However, this result was not replicated for college students. Further, in the undergraduate sample, criticism from mothers moderated the relation between reappraisal and general authenticity. These results have important clinical implications as they indicate the considerable value of parental support for adolescents and young adults in promoting and maintaining authenticity in relationships."
582,21st Century Orientals: The Displacement of Eastern Identities in Contemporary Hollywood Adaptation,"Wang, Annie",Cinema and Media Studies,2014,"Creef, Elena","In an increasingly globalized world, contemporary Hollywood has capitalized on sustained interest in Eastern cultures in the West by adapting popular novels, television shows, video games, and graphic novels into big budget, feature-length films with all-star casts headed by some of the world's most acclaimed directors. However, such adaptations have historically been mired in racially-charged stereotypes that displace and absent Asian bodies and voices from American popular visual media. This thesis examines how recent fantasy-adventure blockbusters such as 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' (2010, dir. Mike Newell), 'The Last Airbender' (2010, dir. M. Night Shyamalan), and 'Cloud Atlas' (2012, dir.

McKnight, Robin","This thesis examines whether access to medical health insurance improves the financial welfare of potentially accessibility-constrained population. Previous studies show that young adults aged 19 to 30 years are disproportionately uninsured compared to the U.S. non-elderly population aged 19 to 64 as a whole. Being uninsured exposes young adults to significant financial risk due to negative medical shocks. Starting in the 1990s, states have sought to address this issue by passing laws allowing adult children to remain on their parents' health insurance, and in 2010 the Affordable Care Act extended this coverage nationwide to dependents through age 26. Using individual level data, we examine how eligibility for health insurance under extended parental coverage laws affects the financial outcomes of adult dependents. We find a significant reduction in bankruptcy risk for young adults being eligible for the health insurance. We conclude that these laws have a positively causal effect on the financial welfare of young adults."
587,Family Violence in Aboriginal Australian Communities: Causes and Potential Solutions,"Littrell, Eden",Political Science,2014,"Wasserspring, Lois
Joseph, William","This thesis is an investigation into why family violence in Aboriginal Australian communities is so severe, and an examination into ways in which this violence might be decreased. It is also a critique of the two competing narratives around violence in Aboriginal communities. The political left typically tells a story about the legacy of violent colonization, and the consequent need to improve Aboriginal legal rights. On the right the narrative is less well defined, but the argument typically focuses on the importance of personal responsibility, or on the role of traditional culture in creating violence. This thesis argues that the competition between these narratives is harmful for actually reducing family violence, and that we should pursue evidence based policy, such as alcohol restrictions, in addition to trialing and evaluating new policies."

In order to be seen as legitimate rulers of a 'natural' national community, the Hashemite monarchy intertwined discourses of national identity and legitimacy in the changing contexts of Arab-Israeli conflicts, radical pan-Arab nationalism, and political Islam. The Jordanian government expressed these discourses by making claims to holy spaces in Jerusalem and (re)constructing various monuments, museums, plazas, and parks in the capital of Amman. However, competing visions of the Jordanian nation also emerged, ranging from nationalist movements that were exclusively Transjordanian to those that identified as Arab nationalist and opposed the monarchy. The struggle to create a unified Jordanian national identity has expressed itself in public spaces as different political and social groups articulated their own visions of what the Jordanian nation should be."

As a result of this exposure, individuals often modify their personal accent to reflect the linguistic environment. This phenomenon of accent acquisition occurs frequently in our multicultural world, but has not been widely researched. Jamaican Creole, known also as Patwa, is spoken to some extent by the majority of Jamaicans and has a close linguistic relationship with Standard American English (SAE). Through oral and written interviews with six Jamaican immigrants living in the United States, this study examines the accent acquisition of SAE from Patwa. The study considers four phonological features that occur differently in Patwa and SAE and that have different levels of phonological complexity. I hypothesized that the participants' acquisition of the SAE accent would be correlated with their length of residency in the U.S., their gender, their motivation for immigration, and their self-reported native language. I also predicted that less complex phonological features would be acquired more fully than more complex phonological features. Overall, I found evidence that strongly supports that all the participants acquired the SAE accent to some extent; none of the participants exhibited all the phonological features of Patwa but neither did they have all the phonological features of SAE. I argue for a plateau effect of acquisition wherein participants undergo an initial period of accent acquisition, which then levels out to an incomplete acquisition of SAE. After accents are deemed acceptable by SAE standards, further accent acquisition is not required. This study also raises concerns about the process of determining phonological complexity, as well as the extent of the impact that complexity has on the acquisition of phonological features."

601,Developing and Assessing New List Operators in App Inventor,"Kim, Soojin",Computer Science,2015,"Turbak, Franklyn","MIT App Inventor is a blocks-based programming environment in which users connect puzzle-shaped blocks to build apps for Android devices. App Inventor supports a Python-like list data structure typically manipulated with loops, but it lacks important list operations that can greatly simplify list manipulation. I have extended the implementation of App Inventor to include new blocks that map, filter, reduce, and sort lists. Since App Inventor does not have first class functions, many of these blocks incorporate the parameter and body declarations of functional arguments associated with these operators. For example, the mapping block has a socket for the input list, a parameter declaration to name each item in the list, and a socket for the expression that denotes the result of transforming the item. There are three sorting blocks: one using a default comparator that arranges the list items in increasing order; one with a key function that returns a proxy value used for sorting the list with the default comparator; and one that uses a comparator provided by the user. In addition, I also addressed the problem that some App Inventor list operators are destructive (they change their input list) while others are nondestructive (they return a new list). This inconsistency can be limiting and confusing to users. To solve this problem, I have implemented a mechanism for many list operators that allows users to choose between making the operator destructive or nondestructive. This flexibility eliminates complicated programming workarounds necessary in the current system. To test the usability of the map, filter, reduce and sort operators, I conducted a user study with 18 students at Wellesley College who had previous experience working with App Inventor. Most users, even those with no previous exposure to map, filter or reduce, were able to successfully complete a majority of the tasks. Two common problems that users faced, however, was manipulating a list of lists using map, filter and/or reduce and sorting a list with two keys. In future work, the results and feedback from this study will be used to iterate through the design of these new blocks."
602,Folders: A Visual Organization System for MIT App Inventor,"Lu, Xixi",Computer Science,2015,"Turbak, Franklyn
Tjaden, Brian
Mustafaraj, Eni","In blocks programming languages, such as MIT App Inventor, programs are built by composing puzzle-shaped fragments on a 2D workspace. Their visual nature makes programming more accessible to novices, but it also has numerous drawbacks. Users must decide where to place blocks on the workspace, and these placements may require the reorganization of other blocks. Block representations are less space efficient than their textual equivalents. Finally, the fundamental 2D nature of the blocks workspace makes it more challenging to search and navigate than the traditional linear workflow. Because of these barriers, users have difficulty creating and navigating complex program In order to address these drawbacks, I have developed Folders, a visual organization system, for App Inventor. Folders, which are modeled after the hierarchical desktop metaphor folders, allow users to nest blocks within them, and solve many of the aforementioned problems. First, users can use Folders, rather than spatial closeness, to place and organize blocks, thereby explicitly indicating a relationship between them. Second, Folders allow users to selectively hide and show particular groups of blocks and address the issue of limited visible space. Lastly, users are already familiar with the folder metaphor from other applications, so their introduction does not complicate App Inventor Unfortunately, Folders also introduce new obstacles. Users might expect that putting blocks into Folders removes them from the main workspace semantically. However, Folders are only for organizing blocks and decluttering the workspace, and their contained blocks are still considered part of the main workspace. Furthermore, Folders exacerbate the search and navigation problem. Since blocks can now be hidden in collapsed Folders, finding a usage or declaration of a variable, procedure, or component can be more difficult. I have received preliminary feedback on my initial implementation of Folders and am designing a user study to evaluate my Folders system."

Given two knots, how can we determine if they are different or the same? To answer this question, we develop and study knot invariants which are properties of knots that remain unchanged under isotopy. Khovanov homology is a powerful knot invariant that is able to distinguish many knots. However, because it is constructed in a combinatorial and algebraic manner, Khovanov homology lacks any geometric or topological motivation. Since Khovanov homology encodes information about topological objects, it would be ideal if it could be interpreted from a topological perspective. One way to approach this is through the lens of manifold calculus of functors and more specifically, the Taylor tower for spaces of long knots. Recent developments have shown that the Jones polynomial, another knot invariant, is encoded in the Taylor tower for knots. Since the Jones polynomial can be extracted from Khovanov homology, it is natural to ask if the Taylor tower can provide a space level realization of Khovanov homology. This paper provides an introduction to Khovanov homology and calculus of functors and offers conjectures that relate the two notions."

614,The Return of Colonialism's Repressed: Postcoloniality in the Art of Walton Ford,"Ahn, Jaeun",Art,2012,"Berman, Patricia G.","This thesis examines a selection of works by the contemporary American artist Walton Ford (b. 1960). Ford's watercolors and prints feature animal and avian protagonists that are rendered in actual scale. His meticulous techniques recall those of eighteenth-and nineteenth century natural science illustrators. Ford often employs illustrations of the North American avifauna from John James Audubon's Birds of America (1827-38) as a reference point. However, his images display complex appropriations that reach across art, literary, and cultural histories. His works are filled with not only embedded visuals with external reference points, but also with written inscriptions bearing complex connotations. As such, this project tackles his works through the following seven-steps.In Chapter One, I introduce Walton Ford and offer a cursory archaeology of his artistic strategies. This initial exegesis is followed up in Chapter Two with a detailed investigation into the prominence of the nineteenth-century naturalist John James Audubon in Walton Ford's works, from his textual references to actual appropriations of Audubon's images. Chapter Three continues the investigation into the discipline of natural history itself, by examining Ford's creation of his own ""unnatural history"" through subversive elements and quotations. Chapter Four takes a deconstructive approach to the tensions between written words and visual images with regard to understanding and formulating narratives-a concern widely considered by contemporary conceptual artists. Chapter Five examines Ford's images in relation to the canon of animal fables, and to their subsequent sociopolitical implications. Chapter Six examines historicism as a theme and issue in contemporary art. To conclude the project, I entertain the complexity of the interpretative process itself in regard to vision and history. This project is not a comprehensive undertaking of the entirety of Ford's extensive artistic corpus. Rather, it takes a postcolonial and a postmodernist approach. This focus on the legacy of nature and narrative in the legacy of imperialism is due to the fact that nature itself is a burdened invocation and Ford's propensity to quote from eighteenth-and nineteenth century texts, calls for such an analysis. This project, therefore, seeks to unpack the repressed postcolonial narratives that are liberated through the art of Walton Ford. —Keywords: Walton Ford (1960- )"

The study focuses on how propagandists used Ireland, Scotland, France, and the United Provinces to impact and influence political sentiments regarding issues of religion, toleration, and rights of the monarchy within England. Both Williamite and Jacobite propagandists used allusions to international political, religious, and ideological issues to garner support for their distinct ideas for the future of England's development. As these two groups consistently placed England in ideological opposition to foreign 'others' within their writings, these parties struggled to define a unique and unified identity for the Kingdom of England and its people. —Keywords: Propaganda -- England -- 17th century, Great Britain -- History -- Revolution of 1688, Revolutions -- History -- 17th century, Great Britain -- Politics and government -- 1660-1714"

Through the use of divinely appointed prophets and apostles, Dominionism has reimagined the structure of the Church and gained a significant following in both the US and abroad. Prophecy and social action are not novel concepts within American Evangelicalism, as previous moral initiatives like Prohibition show. Yet Dominionists seem to have recalibrated these Evangelical practices in order to express their radical worldview. The focus has shifted from moral to total spiritual reform. Practicing a method called spiritual warfare, Dominionists liken themselves to soldiers, engaged in religious combat on a mission proclaimed to them by God. This project explores the eschatological theology, bellicose rhetoric, and furtive practices of Dominionism and asks if and when Christian spiritual warfare will shift from a theological to a violent socio-political movement. —Keywords: Dominion theology"

Decoding skills vary depending on many factors such as personality and environment (Knapp & Hall, 2009). The present study focused on six individual difference measures (the EPI, IOS, PSI, SCS-R, 20-item Shyness Scale, and TSIS) and an experimentally manipulated variable of self-consciousness, to determine their relationship with nonverbal decoding accuracy on two tasks: the METT and the VNDT. The results indicated that four individual difference measures-extraversion, sociability, shyness, and moving toward others-interacted at significant levels with the self-consciousness variable. These predictor variables were found to have a greater impact on performance on the METT than on the VNDT. It is suggested that future research utilizes real interactions as the basis of their decoding task. —Keywords: Nonverbal communication -- Psychological aspects"

Using lattice theory I have shown that there are specific relations with the clique number, chromatic number and number of partitions of a graph, and that there is a correspondence between the vertices not contained in the Jacobson radical J(R) and those contained in J(R). —Keywords: Commutative rings, Graph theory, Lattice theory"

At the transitional moments between day and night, when the sky is filled with such a deep, bright blue that all of the air appears saturated with it, and the uninterrupted horizon turns to black silhouette, you could claim to see the curvature of the Earth. This particular moment has been among my most unforgettable, sublime experiences. It is an experience that words, images, and even film does not have the capacity to translate. It is a felt experience. To me, this defiance of translation seemed to offer an artistic challenge - incorporating video shot in the Nebraska Sandhills, I set out to create an immersive environment that had the power to invoke this same felt experience, suspending an ephemeral moment in time so it can be experienced in the here and now. —Keywords: Installations (Art) -- Exhibitions, Twilight in art"
627,The Effect of Conditional Cash Transfers on Voter Behavior: Evidence from Honduras,"Krishnaswamy, Nandita",Economics,2012,"McEwan, Patrick","The choices that voters make are often influenced by economic circumstances. On a macroeconomic level, better economic indicators are often correlated with better outcomes for incumbents in elections. On a smaller scale, programs that provide fiscal support to poorer households have been shown to increase support for incumbent governments. There are a number of reasons why this might be the case - voters may reward incumbents for benefits received, or they may regard such programs as signals of the incumbent government's investment in their well-being. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are one such type of fiscal intervention. In the past decade, an increasing number of Latin American governments have implemented such programs, which distribute sums of money to targeted households that meet certain conditions such as school enrolment and attendance for school-aged children, and regular health checkups for younger children. In this paper, we consider the effect of one such program, PRAF, on voting outcomes in Honduras. The administration of the program is such that it allows for two empirical strategies: the randomization of treatment among eligible municipalities sets up an experimental estimation strategy, and the threshold of eligibility for the program provides scope for a regression discontinuity estimation at the threshold. Discontinuity estimates indicate that eligibility had a positive effect for the incumbent at the threshold, as expected, but experimental estimates indicate that among the eligible group, those who receive the program are more likely to support the opposition party, perhaps due to administrative difficulties in the distribution of the cash transfers. —Keywords: Voting -- Case studies, Voting -- Honduras, Voting -- Economic aspects"
628,Developing a Three-Dimensional Microenvironment to Investigate Metastatic Cancer Invasion,"Lin, Tiffany",Physics,2012,"Hu, Yue
Franck, Christian","Significant progress has been achieved towards understanding the biochemical aspects of cancer metastasis; yet, less is known about the mechanical processes that govern cancer cell invasion. These mechanical processes include: 1) changes in the elastic properties of cells and 2) changes in the motility of cells triggered by physical properties of the microenvironment. This thesis aims to understand the latter; in particular is the traction behavior of cancer cells as they navigate through different pore sizes. Cells were seeded on 3D hydrogel scaffolds with a structure and dimensionality that mimic the physiological conditions encountered by metastatic cells in vivo. Migratory behavior of these cells were determined by traction force microscopy, a technique used to determine the forces generated by cells on their substrata. Data on cell tractions allowed analysis on the mechanical interplay between cells and their environments. Understanding this interplay can have profound implications on cancer therapy, such as reducing or preventing the migration of these cells. —Keywords: Cancer cells -- Motility, Metastasis, Cancer cells -- Mechanical properties"
629,Biomimetic Modeling of the Active Site of Soluble Methane Monooxygenase Hydroxylase (sMMOH),"Soe, Chan Myae Myae",Chemistry,2012,"Lippard, Stephen J.
Carrico-Moniz, Dora","Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) belongs to a family of metalloproteins called bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs), which contain carboxylate-bridged non-heme diiron cores. These sMMO enzymes are of high interest because they utilize readily available molecular oxygen in their energy conversion of methane to methanol in the metabolic system of methanotrophic bacteria. Methane is abundant in natural gas, and if it can be converted to methanol, a liquid form, under mild conditions as in the enzyme, transportation of this energy source to remote areas will be safer and more convenient. Our research group has a long-term interest in developing small molecule synthetic analogs that can mimic both the structure and function of the active site of the hydroxylase component of sMMO (sMMOH). Unfortunately, no ligand system designed to date has been able to achieve this goal. In our further attempt, synthesis of a triptycene-based bis(benzimidazole) diester ligand L3 is discussed in this paper along with its coordination with iron(II) salt and an external carboxylate. Characterization of the diiron(II) complexes was achieved using UV-vis spectrophometric titrations, X-ray diffraction studies, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy. Preliminary oxygenation studies of the diiron(II) complexes with molecular oxygen is also included. —Keywords: Metalloenzymes, Biomimetics"

James","The United States has long been a powerhouse of Christianity in terms of sheer numbers and has long served as a leader among churches around the world by deploying more Christian missionaries than any other country. However, over the past several decades, the world of Christianity has watched South Korea rise as a powerful Christian nation. My thesis analyzes how this small nation which knew virtually nothing of Christian doctrine when it was first introduced there in 1884 has become a powerhouse of Christianity in the twenty-first century. The research centers around four major questions. One, what has made the Korean Church grow to be so strong over the course of the past century? Two, what factors are unique to the Korean Church to help it grow so quickly? Three, what elements of Christianity so endear it to the hearts of Koreans? Four, what are the implications of the rapid growth of the Korean Church on the Church Universal? This thesis demonstrates that Korean Christians are having two major impacts on the Church Universal, first of all, they are changing the ethnic face of Christianity around the world, and second of all, they are changing the demographics of the Kingdom of Heaven. —Keywords: Korea -- Religion -- 19th century, Missions -- Korea -- History -- 19th century, Christianity and culture -- Korea, Christianity -- Korea (South)"

While education spending has skyrocketed for the past three decades, the high school graduation rate has stagnated. Perhaps of more concern, the U.S. high school graduation rate currently ranks 21st among OECD countries. Three potential factors that could affect teenage schooling decisions are the minimum wage, compulsory schooling laws, and minimum competency testing. The education policies would seem to have an obvious relationship to this outcome. The effects of the minimum wage on schooling decisions, however, have not been documented as extensively. A change in the wage could have a direct effect if an increase in the minimum wage causes teenagers to reevaluate their labor market prospects and then choose to leave school if they feel they can find a higher-paying job, or stay in school if they see fewer jobs being made available. This thesis utilizes three decades of American Community Survey data to perform a quasi-natural experimental analysis that examines the effects of the minimum wage, compulsory schooling laws, and minimum competency testing on teenage schooling decisions. I find that an increase in the minimum wage has little effect on the high school dropout rate, but it encourages some students to enter the labor force after graduating from or completing high school rather than going on to tertiary education. Additionally, compulsory schooling laws increase high school graduation rates, but exit examinations, it turns out, have a counterproductive effect, inducing some students to drop out or take the GED rather than submit to the requirement. —Keywords: Secondary Education -- Economic aspects -- United States, Secondary Education -- Government policy -- United States, Minimum wage"

Berman, Patricia","In the summer of 1953, one could hardly call Merce Cunningham's group of dancers ""a company"" in the formal sense of the term. At the time it was only one of many protean artistic experiments taking shape at Black Mountain College, a hotbed of intellectual activity where artists' ideas circulated freely across the disciplines of music, dance, and the visual arts. Black Mountain fostered a collaborative setting for some of the most important creative minds of the second half of the twentieth century, yet during that summer their place in the American artistic pantheon was far from guaranteed. My thesis explores Cunningham's unlikely trajectory in becoming a cultural icon through an analysis of his aesthetic, networks, and funding. The project attempts to address the question of how this marginal experiment came to represent twentieth century American dance. —Keywords: Merce Cunningham"
642,Universal cycles for k-subsets of an n-set,"Lanius, Melinda",Mathematics,2012,"Schultz, Andrew","Generalized from the classic de Bruijn sequence, a universal cycle is a compact cyclic list of information. Existence of universal cycles has been established for a variety of families of combinatorial structures. These results, by encoding each object within a combinatorial family as a length-j word, employ a modified version of the de Bruijn graph to establish a correspondence between an Eulerian circuit and a universal cycle. We explore the existence of universal cycles for k-subsets of the integers {1, 2,...,n}. The fact that sets are unordered seems to prevent the use of the established encoding techniques used in proving existence. We explore this difficulty and introduce an intermediate step that may allow us to use the familiar encoding and correspondence to prove existence. Moreover, mathematicians Persi Diaconis and Ron Graham hold that ""the construction of universal cycles has proceeded by clever, hard, ad-hoc arguments"" and that no general theory exists. Accordingly, our work pushes for a more general approach that can inform other universal cycle problems. —Keywords: Algebraic cycles, Combinatorial analysis, Graph theory"

644,Representing Expressive Types in Blocks Programming Languages,"Vasek, Marie",Computer Science,2012,"Turbak, Franklyn","In blocks programming languages, such as Scratch and App Inventor, programs are created by connecting visual program fragments shaped like jigsaw puzzle pieces. The shapes of these blocks help novices avoid frustrating syntax errors commonly encountered in textual programming languages by strongly suggesting how expressions and statements are composed to form programs. In statically typed programming languages, every expression has a type that indicates the kind of value it denotes (e.g. number, string, boolean). Types allow a programmer to more effectively reason about the behavior of their program. In blocks languages, the shapes of the block connectors can be used to indicate type, but they currently handle only simple types and do so in an ad hoc and confusing fashion. For example, in Scratch numbers and strings have the same shape, allowing users to do nonsensical things such as find the square root of a string. The goal of this project is to create a blocks version of a language similar to ML, a statically typed programming language with expressive types. For example, the ML type (int list) * (string list) -> (int * string) list describes a function that takes as arguments an integer list and string list and returns as a result a list whose elements are pairs of integers and strings. I developed TypeBlocks, a statically typed blocks language for a functional language with list, tuple, and function types implemented in the blocks framework ScriptBlocks. In TypeBlocks, each arbitrarily complex type is translated into a unique connector shape. TypeBlocks also handles ML-style universal polymorphism. This project aims to aid novice programmers and help them more clearly comprehend types. —Keywords: Programming languages (Electronic computers)"
645,Sound Thread Local Analysis for Lockset-Based Dynamic Data Race Detection,"Mincheva, Samuila",Computer Science,2017,"Wood, Benjamin P.","Multithreading is a powerful model of parallel and concurrent programming. However, the presence of shared data leaves multithreaded programs vulnerable to concurrency errors such as data races, where two threads access and modify the same data concurrently and without synchronization. Data races lead to unpredictable program behavior and can be a source of data corruption. This work improves the precision of lockset-based dynamic data race detection without compromising soundness. Typically, lockset-based algorithms are sound but extremely imprecise. The algorithms presented in this work improve the precision of such algorithms by including thread-tracking information. Thread tracking helps detect patterns of intermittent thread-locality of shared data and eliminate false errors while still reporting all true errors. Experimental results show that thread-local analysis preserves soundness and improves precision of lockset-based data race detection by an average of 82%, with run-time slowdowns of less than 17%."
646,Low-Skilled Immigration and the Elderly: How Immigrants Influence the Living Arrangements and Health Outcomes of Elderly Individuals in the U.S.,"Moran, Kelsey",Economics,2017,"Butcher, Kristin","The current aging of the U.S. population carries substantial social and economic costs, as many elderly individuals must seek out assistance with long-term medical and custodial care. This paper studies whether increases in the number of low-skilled immigrants, who are disproportionately concentrated in the health care and home production fields, have impacted the housing decisions and health of elderly individuals. Using an instrumental variable strategy to exploit state-by-time variation in the concentration of immigrants in the U.S., I find that low-skilled immigration increases the share of low-skilled labor in the labor force, which in turn decreases the probability of elderly persons living in institutions. Given that elderly individuals have indicated preferences for aging within their own homes as opposed to moving into skilled nursing facilities, these results imply that the composition of local labor markets can encourage the actualization of elderly choice. My results on elderly mortality, however, are less conclusive. The findings suggest a positive impact of increased low-skilled labor force shares on the average age at death for the elderly but an insignificant impact on aggregate mortality rates."

What becomes apparent through a close-reading of the text, however, is their struggle, not their success, in establishing their own authority in medieval society as represented by the circle of Canterbury pilgrims. The Man of Law boasts of his occupation and credentials in order to substantiate his claims of understanding God's mysterious ways, but comes across as rather bumbling and foolish in his futile attempts to apply religious concepts to material success. The Wife of Bath strives to establish herself as an alternative authority to the male-dominated Church, but finds herself, in her concerns and spirit, confined to clerical language; she can only use the literal interpretation of the Bible to defend herself against the slander made by the Church, and this is not so much an example of heresy as it is evidence of being constrained by the language we seek to subvert. The Pardoner is perhaps the most difficult figure to read. Ultimately, however, he faces the same problem of trying to pin down his authoritative value within clerical discourse. This thesis focuses on the struggle of transcending the clerical language that confined medieval society and identity as depicted in Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales."
648,Estradiol alters the gut microbiota response to high-fat diet,"Nagyal, Manjot Kaur",Biological Chemistry,2017,,"Post-menopausal women have an increased risk of developing metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-two diabetes. Estradiol, a type of estrogen, which is primarily produced by ovaries and declines in postmenopausal women, protects against diet-induced obesity in women and female mice. However, the mechanisms by which estradiol prevents diet-induced obesity are not completely understood. Host diet has been shown to shift the compositional pattern of the gut microbiota­, and both diet and the gut microbiome have been linked to weight gain and obesity. We hypothesized that one mechanism by which estradiol-treated mice resist diet-induced weight gain is through the gut microbiota. For my thesis, I investigated the effects of estradiol on the gut microbiota to a diet change and analyzed the fecal gut microbiota from fourteen adult C57BL6 mice that were ovariectomized and subcutaneously implanted with capsules containing either 17β-estradiol (E2) or oil (vehicle; control; Veh). All mice were fed a standard rodent diet for 10 days and then switched to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 25 days. To identify and compare microbial community composition of samples across treatments, we analyzed the longitudinal 16S rRNA gene data from fecal pellets. I observed that E2 treatment altered the gut microbiota response and structure following the diet change. Specifically, the gut microbiota in E2 mice response to the diet change was attenuated compared to the Veh mice. Moreover, HFD-fed mice were characterized by increased relative abundances of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but these HFD-induced shifts were conservative for the E2-treated group. With the diet change and the lack of E2 treatment, fecal endotoxin levels and taxa associated with inflammatory and metabolic diseases increased greatly, such as Helicobacter and Peptostreptococcaceae. Comparatively, the diet change had no effect on endotoxin levels and induced slight increases in abundance of these inflammatory and metabolic disease associated taxa in E2 mice. Microbes characterized as metabolizers of plant-based diets, such as Ruminococcaceae and S24-7, were, however, associated with and in higher abundance in E2 mice than Veh mice during HFD. In summary, HFD disturbs the gut microbiota diversity and composition, but the HFD associated changes are lessened with E2 treatment. The reduced response and alterations in the gut microbiota to dietary change in E2 mice may be a critical component in understanding the complexities by which estradiol protects against obesity."

650,Characterization of the Source Rocks Exposed in the Permian Florida Mountains of Equatorial Pangea.,"Okhai, Disha",Geosciences,2017,"Hawkins, David P.","U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircon grains in clastic sedimentary rocks has become an important tool for constraining the provenance of ancient sediment and reconstructing the paleogeography (landscapes, prevailing wind directions) of ancient continents (e.g., Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013). Such detrital zircon studies typically rely only on U-Pb dates of at least 100 grains per sample. In contrast, this study employs an emerging petrochronological approach that combines zircon crystal growth histories, U-Pb dates, and trace element geochemistry on hundreds of grains to fingerprint sources of ancient sediment with greater fidelity. Such an approach is used to evaluate the provenance of Cambrian detrital zircon in the Late Paleozoic Brushy Canyon Formation of the Delaware Basin in west Texas. Previous work by the Hawkins research group suggests that these ca. 500 Ma detrital zircon grains were derived from a local source in the ancient Florida uplift, preserved today in the Florida Mountains of southwestern New Mexico. This study evaluates their hypothesis by further characterizing the petrochronology of zircon grains in rocks that were exposed in, and eroded from the Florida uplift during the Late Paleozoic. Two rock units exposed in the Florida Mountains of southwestern New Mexico, the Cambrian Florida Mountain granite, and the Ordovician Bliss sandstone, yield igneous zircon grains (n=309) with ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U dates of 500-530 Ma, and distinctive trace element compositions consistent with within plate crustal magmatism. Circa 500 Ma detrital zircon grains (n=359) from sandstones in the Brushy Canyon Formation of the Delaware Basin overlap in both age and trace element composition with zircon from the hypothesized source rocks in the Florida Mountains (as well as related granite sources in Oklahoma). These results are consistent with the proposed hypothesis that the Cambrian plutons and related rocks were an important local/regional source for sediment in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, this study demonstrates the efficacy of zircon petrochronology as an approach for fingerprinting the provenance of sediment on ancient continents."
651,Simulating A Third Culture Kid Experience to Enhance Friendship Prospects in Early Interactions,"Ozcan, Meltem",Psychology,2017,"Bahns, Angela","Third Culture Kids (TCK), individuals that experience high mobility and multicultural exposure in their developmental years, tend to skip small talk and begin disclosing emotional or personal information in the early stages of the relationship. The phrase accelerated self-disclosure will be used here on to refer to such disclosures of moderate to moderately high intimacy that occur early on in a relationship. This thesis project explored which aspects of the TCK experience affect friendship-related behavior. In Study 1, TCKs (N=50) and non-TCKs (N=47) were compared on relational mobility, residential mobility, open-mindedness, cultural empathy and their approaches to friendships. TCKs were more likely to engage in accelerated self-disclosures, and reported more relationship interest for a potential friend who brought up an intimate topic in an imagined early interaction than non-TCKs. The two samples showed significantly different perceptions of intimacy for high and low intimacy topics. TCKs were more open-minded, extraverted, had higher cultural empathy and perceived less relational mobility than non-TCKs. In Study 2, non-TCKs (N= 256) were primed for open-mindedness and rated their relationship interest for a discloser in a video task as well as in an imagined scenario. Participants exposed to an accelerated self-disclosure in a prior task were more welcoming of accelerated self-disclosures in the imagined scenario task than participants who were exposed to small talk. Findings suggest that open-mindedness, a sense of urgency about establishing relationships and a shared understanding of what early interactions entail are instrumental in the development of accelerated self-disclosures in TCKs."
652,A Community of Capital: Leveraging Peer Networks at Community Colleges,"Phelps, Christina",Sociology,2017,"Rutherford, Markella","This thesis uses theories of social and cultural capital to explain how community college students are capital-rich individuals who navigate their community colleges with strategies that reflect and build on their class habitus. In depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 traditional-aged college students at Midwestern Community College. Qualitative analysis revealed that students' social and cultural capital allows them to experience the community college in four distinct ways: as an Involved Student Leader, a Visiting Collegian, a Free Rider, or a Determined but Disconnected student. Involved Student Leaders and Visiting Collegians, with institution-valued forms of capital, have socially and academically integrated experiences at the college, and work to extend their capital to others. Free Riders' low academic orientation but middle class habitus is amenable to being on the receiving end of capital exchange. Determined but Disconnected students have mismatched strategies and forms of capital that exclude them from the active exchange and acquisition of social and cultural capital at the community college. Student experiences reveal that community college is a field in which students are actors who aid in each other's success. However, this level of higher education must value all forms of social and cultural capital if it is to be an institution where all students have an equal chance at succeeding."
653,The Effect of Access to Prenatal Genetic Testing on Test Utilization and Birth Outcomes: Evidence from Down syndrome,"Plachinski, Leah",Economics,2017,"Coile, Courtney","Recent scientific advancements have greatly improved prenatal genetic testing technologies, which can now detect a wide array of genetic disorders at a high degree of accuracy. Down syndrome provides a unique context through which to analyze the effect of women's access to prenatal genetic tests on test utilization and birth outcomes. In particular, typically only women of Advanced Maternal Age (AMA)-that is, women aged 35 and older-have qualified for an amniocentesis, the most common prenatal diagnostic test for Down syndrome. Using Vital Statistics live birth data from 1989 to 2002, I exploit the arbitrary nature of this AMA amniocentesis eligibility cutoff by implementing a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design to quantify the effect of access to amniocentesis on amniocentesis use and birth outcomes. As a secondary component of my analysis, I explore whether the effect of access to amniocentesis shifted over the course of the 1990s, as alternative prenatal genetic tests for Down syndrome became available. I find that becoming eligible for an amniocentesis increased the probability a woman underwent an amniocentesis by 6.2 percentage points (or 62% relative to the mean take-up rate of women around the cutoff), but that the increase in amniocentesis take-up at age 35 diminished significantly throughout the late 1990s. This negative time-trend in amniocentesis take-up at age 35 implies that over the latter half of my sample period, many amniocentesis-eligible women substituted away from amniocentesis and towards alternative prenatal genetic tests for Down syndrome that presented less risk to the fetus. Finally, I find no evidence that women terminated pregnancies that tested positive for Down syndrome or that test access affected other birth outcomes."

Minor, Elizabeth","The Cooking Hypothesis proposes that morphological changes in early Homo erectus fossils indicate a dietary shift most parsimoniously explained by higher dietary returns from consuming cooked foods. Despite these theoretical expectations, the archaeological record has not provided solid evidence for this behavioral transition at the appearance of H. erectus. The site of FxJj20 (1.6 Ma, Koobi Fora, Kenya) shows compelling evidence for controlled fire through various proxies such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy; magnetic susceptibility data; and thermally altered lithics (potlids, thermal curved fragments). Another potential proxy of hominin fire use is the recovery of phytoliths (silicified plant cells) from ancient sites, because they resist degradation and discolor in ~ 700°C heat. Multiple proxies are needed in ancient, open-air contexts, like FxJj 20, because of the potential for post-depositional disturbance of these sites. To develop inferences of behavior from phytolith data requires extensive experimentation to provide expectations regarding the frequency and distribution of phytoliths in high intensity localized fires. This thesis looks at evidence left by modern experimental fires in a floodplain environment, similar to the environment at the site of FxJj20 AB. The experimental fires varied in duration, frequency, and location to study how phytolith coloration and count change with different fire conditions. The results show that controlled fire has an impact on the proportion of discolored phytoliths, specifically impacting the number of discolored phytoliths in the assemblage. They also show that phytolith assemblage composition is variable between and within fire contexts which is likely due to the multitude of factors that impact fire temperature and sample size."

Raines, Ronald T.","Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) are a promising solution to the problem of molecular delivery. Many CPPs are cationic, and it is believed that electrostatic interactions with anionic proteoglycans on the surface of cell membranes, such as heparan sulfate, is a major factor in the ability of CPPs to translocate into cells. Arginine residues in CPPs are thought to contribute strongly to these electrostatic interactions due to the positively charged guanidinium moiety on the arginine sidechain capable of forming bidentate hydrogen bonds. Previous work within the Raines lab has demonstrated a correlation between the binding affinity (K_d) that molecules containing guanidinium moieties have for methyl sulfate, and their acidity (pKₐ). A synthetic route for canavanine diamide (3) was developed in order to explore the impact the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom at the gamma position has on K_d for methyl sulfate. The stability of canavanine diamide at room temperature and under physiologically relevant conditions was also assessed."

Dougherty, Carol
Cain, William","Through a literary analysis of Euripides' Helen, Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, and Plato's Symposium, I will demonstrate how Alcibiades as a public figure pushed the Athenian imagination into new forms of literary expression. The first element of this claim will explore how both Helen and Alcibiades embody the polyvalent quality of eros. While both figures undoubtedly incite personal desire, I will suggest that Helen and Alcibiades simultaneously evoke a political eros that is representative of the imperialistic desire that devastated Athens in the fifth century. In addition, I will argue that ancient authors were forced to transgress literary genres in order to not only address the complicated issues Helen and Alcibiades raised, but also to best encapsulate the chaotic and contradictory personalities of both figures. Within the Greek literary world, every genre correlated with a certain occasion or performance, as seen in the marked difference between public and private performance.As these new genres emerged, they not only reflected a change in literature, but a change within the civic community and that communitys particular needs.I will apply this cultural poetics approach to my thesis, as I argue that the un-categorization of Alcibiades and Helen reflects a larger shift in Athens as the polis diverged from the moderate Periclean policies of the mid-5th century towards the imperialist ideology of Alcibiades and his followers."
658,The Failed Emergence of an Anglo-Soviet Cooperation Against Germany: 1930s British Perception of Soviet and German Threats,"Miyazaki, Makiko",Political Science,2020,"Goddard, Stacie E.","Between 1933 and 1938, Nazi Germany's recrudescent power threatened to plunge Europe into another world war. To mitigate the German threat of aggression, Britain had two choices: to mollify Germany through appeasement or to challenge it through an Anglo-Soviet cooperation. Britain ultimately chose appeasement, resulting in the 1938 Munich Agreement, and the conventional wisdom alleges the reason to be because the British perceived the Soviet Union to be a greater threat than Germany. This thesis critically examines this argument. Between 1933 and 1938, how much consensus was there among the British policymaking elites that the Soviet Union was a greater threat than Germany and that an Anglo-Soviet cooperation was ill-advised? Through an examination of Prime Minster Neville Chamberlain, the Parliament, and the diplomatic corps using materials that include speeches, private letters, government documents, and internal memos, I find that the conventional wisdom has limited explanatory power. Instead, I argue that there was, in fact, overwhelming consensus that Germany was the greater threat, and dissensus lay in what was the best strategy for Britain to address the German threat. Although fervent arguments for an Anglo-Soviet cooperation persisted until the eve of the Munich Agreement, supporters of appeasement were ultimately greater in number and authority, and the case for British overtures to the Soviets was lost."
