# January Project

The following repository contains the work I produced during the January Project - an experiential learning experience, where I was allowed to explore data of my choice surrounding Wellesley College.

I explored the data surrounding faculty members at Wellesley as well as course thesis found in the Wellesley online repository.

The following folder and files are included in this repository: 

### Folders
- datasets: includes all the datasets that were scraped from the provost faculty roster page (https://www.wellesley.edu/provost/facultyroster)
as well as these datasets after cleaning. 

- thesis: small project surrounding the Wellesley College theses found in the online repository of the college 

### Files:
- Professor_Info: notebook to scrape current faculty data, cleaning the data and exploring the contents of the data

- Gathering historical faculty data: notebook to scrape data with the help of the web archives of past faculty rosters

- Cleaning past faculty data: uses the datasets collected using the previous notebook and cleans the datasets for further processing

- Exploring historical faculty data: exploratory data analysis surrounding the collected datasets and faculty at Wellesley over the years
