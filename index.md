## Welcome to my January Project Work

As part of the Wellesley Data Collective January Project I focused on exploring data related to Wellesley College. I collected faculty data starting in 2012 explored faculty education as well as other information surrounding their positions and employement. 

### Overview

This project includes scraped data files that were extracted from the Wellesley College website along with the analysis in form of Jupyter notebooks coded in Python. The code is accompanied with comments along the way to facilitate the reader to understand the different steps that went into cleaning and analyzing the data.
