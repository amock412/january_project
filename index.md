# Welcome to my January Project Work

As part of the Wellesley Data Collective January Project I focused on exploring data related to Wellesley College. I collected faculty data starting in 2012 explored faculty education as well as other information surrounding their positions and employement. 

## Overview

The project repositor includes scraped data files that were extracted from the Wellesley College website along with the analysis in form of Jupyter notebooks coded in Python. The code is accompanied with comments along the way to facilitate the reader to understand the different steps that went into cleaning and analyzing the data. 
All files used to scrape and visualize data can be found here: https://github.com/amock412/january_project 

## Motivation 
This January Project was centered around exploring data from Wellesley College. I was interested in exploring course data and faculty data at Welelsley college. Having discovered a list of current faculty members I thought it would be interesting to gather mroe information on the faculty body as a whole.

## Data 
The data was scraped from the faculty roster (https://www.wellesley.edu/provost/facultyroster) with the help of Selenium and later cleaned in Python.

# Findings 

Examining the current faculty roster, the top universities faculty members visited included Harvard, Yale and Wellesley.
