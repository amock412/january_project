# Welcome to my January Project Work

As part of the Wellesley Data Collective January Project I focused on exploring data related to Wellesley College. I collected faculty data starting in 2012 explored faculty education as well as other information surrounding their positions and employement. 

## Overview

The project repositor includes scraped data files that were extracted from the Wellesley College website along with the analysis in form of Jupyter notebooks coded in Python. The code is accompanied with comments along the way to facilitate the reader to understand the different steps that went into cleaning and analyzing the data. 
All files used to scrape and visualize data can be found here: ![link](https://github.com/amock412/january_project)

## Motivation 
This January Project was centered around exploring data from Wellesley College. I was interested in exploring course data and faculty data at Welelsley college. Having discovered a list of current faculty members I thought it would be interesting to gather mroe information on the faculty body as a whole.

## Data 
The data was scraped from the faculty roster ![link](https://www.wellesley.edu/provost/facultyroster) with the help of Selenium and later cleaned in Python.

# Findings 

Examining the current faculty roster, the top universities faculty members visited included Harvard, Yale and Wellesley.

In addition we looking at the degrees that faculty obtained, one can see that because not all faculty members necessarily need a phd for teaching 
(such as PE faculty or music faculty) the degrees obtained by faculty varies.

Surprisingly enough the deptartments with the most faculty members are physical education and music. The high number of music faculty is partly due to the fact that the performance faculty were also counted as part of the music department making the total number of faculty members higher than in other departments.

In addition, the total number of faculty has stayed fairly constant for the past 10 years as can be seen here.
